0,5,This is the best laptop in this range.I recieved late delivery due to big billion sale but the waiting was worth it. I played The Witcher 3 and Far Cry 4 in ULTRA graphics and it was running super smooth without any lag. So for gaming its a Beast no doubt. After 2 days I was getting charging issue and the charging was very slow so I contacted HP support via whatsapp and they told me to update the BIOS and after updating it was back to super fast charging and even the system was running faster...
1,5,Good product as used of now.... Everything is good and also SSD slot is given for upgradation.... Only keys of Keyboard are not looking as reliable as other basic HP laptops....it has been a month now... I will use it for three months again and will update my review.....
2,5,AWESOME LAPTOP. It supports many high spec games like gta 5. Super quality. I liked it very much
3,4,"For that price... it's exceptionally good. Played Far Cry 4 at Ultra Graphics 1080p.. was super smooth. So was GTA V, Just Cause 4. So you can do pretty decent gaming. General PC performance is good. Photoshop 2020 (June) works perfectly and also other Adobe products. Display is super cool too. So yeah, a good system overall for that price."
4,4,"RAM upgrade is must do because the useable RAM is only 6GB, Ryzen 5 3550H is a great processor however eats up 2GB RAM in system, Due to that Heavy games like GTA 5 stutter, The FPS while gaming is good however stuttering happens when games doesn‚Äôt get enough RAM, Due to which I have to spend another 3.5K to put a 2nd 8GB ram stick. Rest all Is good Display is crisp Battey is good for gaming laptop anyway to play games chargers needs to be plugged in, Although the 5400 RPM HDD is quite slow m..."

6,5,It's good gameing laptop in this price Display is good battery backup is good And I like keyboard üòÅüëå
7,4,Best laptop in this price range... Believe me if you are willing to buy this laptop don't hesitate just go Nd buy it !! Booting takes 22 sec... If you want more faster then I will recommend you to go for ssd variant... Speed of HDD is not that slow people are reviewing aboveüôÑ... Nd wait wait wait people are also saying above ram is the problem only given 6 GB so every device have some pre installed software so non of the brand will provide u 8 out of 8 gbs ü§¶‚ôÇÔ∏è...there is no problem with the...
8,4,"The AMD APU is a disappointment. If you guys don't know, the amd integrated graphics will reserve 2gb of your ram so you are left with 6gb instead of 8. HP has also locked their bios so we can't change vram settings either. It is what it is, I'll recommend that you should go for an Intel cpu if you can bcz amd might be cheaper but they will eat your hardware even though you are not using it at all so it's a waste of 1/4 of ram you paid for. Other than that Gtx1650 is a beast and ryzen 5 will ..."
9,4,Okay so ive been using this laptop since a few days/weeks now and i really like it 1. The display is good 2. The Laptop runs smoothly 3. Upgradable which is a big pro 4. Great sound quality 5. beautiful build 6. Games work nicely Cons 1. A little bit slow but that can be upgraded using a ram and ssd 2. I play fortnite and rocket league on it and they run smoothly but sometimes theres a frame drop which again can be solved by ssd and ram  Overall i would really say this is a great laptop
10,5,This is my 2nd laptop and ti be true i like it preety much. The booting speed is good and can be more if you install ssd in it.  Overall look wise it's awesome üëåüòç.  I played Apex legend in low graphic settings and it runs smoothly  The lappy can become a beast if you upgrade the ssd and ram ‚úåÔ∏è An additional of around 5k to 9k can be done to reach it's maximum potential. I'm happy with it üòä
11,5,"I am using it for a day what i have noticed is it gets a little hot from the bottom right but it's manageable. The screen is beautiful, backlit keyboard makes it total worth the price. I bought it for 48,875 and it delivers really good specifications and quality. Overall it's a great product if you're getting it under 50k. If not then you should wait for some Flipkart sale."
12,4,Look perfect üíï Display is nice Sound quality is superb üíï Performance :- A little bit laggy... But if you upgrade with ssd then it gives you a good performance .. 5 day genuine review
13,4,"The true potential of this thing is unleashed when it's plugged in. Don't even bother to game on this thing on battery only. Battery backup about 5 Hrs on normal uses like browsing, video streaming etc with both wifi and Bluetooth ON.  2GB out of the 8GB RAM is reserved for Vega 8 which is a real bummer. So another RAM of 8GB 2400 MHz is recommended at slot 2.  Pair it with an SSD ( ofcourse nvme recommend ) and feel the difference.  Be sure to download GeForce Experience.  Update all the dr..."
14,1,"Don't ever buy this laptop , the description says it's a gaming laptop but it can't handle games like gta 5 and goes into hibernation mode within 5 minutes of the game and out of the 8gb ram only 5.9 gb is available and performance is not that slick , hence would advise anyone looking to buy this , avoid it and spend extra and get yourself a better laptop"
15,5,"Good packaging, right on time, gorgeous design and lovely performance, best buy for beginners"
16,4,Nice product Battery mostly 4 to 5 hours But performance was very nice 4 star for late delivery otherwise product was very nice at this price Booting take normal time but its good in hdd Because sdd was fast comparable to hdd I think this is the drawback Company needs to modify ssd on this product
17,5,This review is after using this laptop for 6 months. Display:10/10 Performance:10/10 Battery:8/10 No heating issues No fan noise while normal usage Suggestions: 1.try to add extra 8 gb ram.because amd integrated graphic card uses 2gb of ram and available ram is only 6gb. 2.try to add 500gb ssd and move your os to ssd. Then you laptop enters into beast mode  Overall great laptop with amazing specs. Blindly go for it.
18,5,"This is an initial impression review. The battery life, display and design are above par. Gaming experience is terrific with a good, strong card inside. The issue might be the 2GB RAM reseved by RX Vega which is the inbuilt mobile gpu of Ryzen. All in all, a good package and a great value for money. My suggestion would be to install an ssd and an additional 8 GB RAM in the near future to get the most out of the product. Note : Disappointed by flipkart for not putting in bubble wrap in the pa..."
19,5,greate deal for the price to performance ratio. for gaming it is good but only one problem it heats up quickly so for better you should keep it on cool surface for gaming . Other things are exellent. 'I loved the experience
20,5,Product is excellent but battery is draining is lot faster than I expected but it is above average. Overall product is good and I think you also get what you paid for. I am happy with laptop.
21,1,"Sorry, after 2 months of buying now....I am thinking why I bought this laptop ....I recommend don't buy you can go with intel instead of ryzen ...I bought it for coding and designing purpose but yet I haven't installed such softwares ...still it is getting hang while watching yt on it ... just like our Android get if memory gets full ...and also some time sentence of some part getting on screen adruptly ....design and display of lappi is excellent but had performence ...."
22,4,Good product performance really awsome and powerful battery life...üòáüòáüòç.. I like it very much
23,4,It is having a wonderful build design ? Build quality is really good Bcoz of not having ssd it's not that fast in opening files apps and softwares It doesn't gets too much heat Overall satisfied with the product
24,5,"Overall this is best buy in this price range. Only issue I found that it has 5.9 gigs of Usuable ram out of 8 gigs because of integrated amd graphics. It gives approximately 40 to 60 fps in high end games like watch dogs 2, gta v, Witcher 3 at high settings. Battery is decent, display quality is good....."
25,5,It is a bit slow.... If you want faster experience install ssd in it. It has SSD slot or you can go for SSD variant.Other than this all are woking good. I think this may not be a big problem. I loved it.... The gaming experience is so nice...overall performance is good..
26,5,Good Experience with this Product. For better more smoothness and for better experience upgrade add 256 GB SSD in it .
27,4,It's small...Design good...Clarity awesome....Performance is good after 1 week use...Battery charges fast and stands nearly 6 hours for normal use ...One minor problem when it's charging we can't use the mouse touch pad smoothly...It's jumping and lagging....Better use separate mouse like i do...Just cause 3 plays very smoothly...Only 6 gb ram we can use as a default... Over all its a good one ...
28,4,"The laptop in short is a beast.For peaple owning a laptop for the first time,it would be bliss.It has many flaws(with HDD).But for those who are willing to take care of their laptop,it will work like a charm. Overall,I would say just to go for it."
29,4,Product is awesome I m fully satisfied with the product. Display quality is superb But the delivery experience was not so good took almost 15 days to deliver the product..
30,5,"Excellent laptop for professional as well as gaming purpose. I am writing this review after 1 month of use. First when I got the product it was not the proper product as the OS was having some problem. But immediately hp service man have checked and cleared the problem. I am using this laptop for design purpose. I use to work with AutoCAD, CATIA, SOLIDWORKS, etc. These applications are running super smooth and speed in this laptop. However if you are using this kind of high end applications ..."
31,5,"I am writing these reviews after using 3 months of using this laptop.  Points: 1. RAM capacity is 8GB. If you want to enjoy gaming, atleast install 16GB RAM. 2. I played games like AC Valhalla, GTA 5, RDR 2, Days Gone, Witcher, AC Oddesey, watch dogs 2 and many more. At the highest graphics settings you can sense some lag, but good for mid range graphics. 3.Heating Issue: Yes, this can heat up a lot, but to mention gaming laptops use graphics so that is natural. To use the most out of laptop,..."
32,5,"I have been using this for a week now. Short answer, just go for it, the best non chinese laptop under this price segment. I brought it for 48k. I have seen most of the reviews saying performance is not great. First things first you have to plug in while you are gaming otherwise you won't be getting the peak performance or just set battery to best performance while you are not plugged in.  Boot time with HDD: Again I have seen many reviews saying it takes around 1 and half minute to boot ..."
33,3,"One of the best budget gaming laptop loved it üòò. Smooth performance, good graphics card but it would have been better if there were other colors of RGB lights on the keyboards and u cannot change the color of the keyboard lights. But good laptop beast performance."
34,5,"Actually it's good ,no problem yet .just update your windows and it will became more fast. You can also add ssd and ram if you needed. Look wise it is great and battery charges very fast due to 150 watt charger.  Actually it's perfect if you add ssd and ram"
35,4,"I bought this laptop for a balance routine like moderate gaming and normal work, and i have no complaints. The battery backup is really good of around 4hrs 30min to 5 hrs. The keyboard is well lit and you have no problem seeing the buttons even in dark room conditions. Ive been using this for 3 months now and I HAVE NO ISSUES with it. Do keep in mind that this comes with the TRIAL version of Microsoft Office and not the full version. It comes with McAfee antivirus which does a really good j..."
36,5,Performance was awesome .....it has Amd Rhyzen 5 3550H processor which has slightly lower base clock speed of 2.1 GHz but that works much better than Intel Core i5 9th gen and also neck to neck i5 10th gen....some said it was also better than i7 9th gen ....which I can even realise when it renders videos within minutes in DaVinci Resolve which is most renowned video editing software and heavy software in the industry...but that is only possible with an extra installation of M.2 Nvme SSD from...
37,5,"Pictures don't do justice.. Product is awesome and built quality is too good. Looks premium. Upgrade to ssd for most of this beast.. Display is awesome. Backlit is good. Purple is better than >>>red, white.. I have used many of them... Battery is 4 hours.. Overall it's a beast under 50k..  If u are getting it under 55k go for it..  Out of 8 gb ram 6 gb ram is what we get.."
38,5,I ordered this laptop a month ago and I really love it So this review is for those who aren't sure if it's worth it well to be honest it has a average battery in terms of me rating it But it is really fast and the screen is really good Design wise and performance is really good It comes with a ryzen 5 processor and gtx 1650 Graphics card Which is really great Especially for gaming U can play fortnite above 60 fps and 120 fps with no problem Go for it it's really worth it The only is...
39,5,"Very Good Packaging. Product safely kept. Received the product in good condition. Clean Stuff. Only problem is the RAM, 6GB is only usable out of 8GB"
40,4,"Ok, so I have a lot to say. First of all, I ordered this laptop for my sister on 7th Nov. My father purchased it and it was fast delivered. Coming to packaging. Flipkart terrible packaging from the outermost. When we first unboxed it the hp package was perfect in condition. The laptop was fresh as anticipated. It was perfectly sealed. Ok now coming to the product. I'll say it directly. Pros Display-15.6 perfect if you want a big screen and got bored of a 14 inch one Processor-a ryzen 5 3550h..."
41,4,This Laptop has a HDD which is really slow at booting...i would recommend you to buy a M.2 NVME SSD for Faster boot time and great performance...and also add up an 8GB ddr4 RAM for great performance
42,4,Nice and best product as per specification but only battery backup is needed and i will suggest tjat if you are buying this product then please insert an SSD for smooth and better experience in it.
43,4,"absolutely satisfied with the product. No ssd in this one but believe me it boots up in freaking 20 seconds. its just mind boggling. performance wise its descent handles my alll the tasks like a charm and it has got a good cooling system as well. fan not so loud so . if u r having a strict budget around 52k just go for this, spending little more and getting a hexa core proccesor model 1021ax would be wiser though. go for it u wont be dissapointed.  Edit: if u buy this one here after do not uo..."
44,4,Overall This Laptop Is Great But Someone Who Want Something Perfect I inform You That For Ame Lovers Its gReat thing as 4gb graphics and 8 gb ram is spectacular on the other hand battery drains quickly when you play games its important to plug in charger while playing  Screen size is small compare to others but its budget friendly so no offense  Need ssd for the fast startup and game lags due to it when power supply is not connected  I lost my battery sign on the taskbar so if anyone know how...
45,4,Best at this price range only compromising thing is its ram but 6 gb ram also handle many AAA titles with ease but you may notice some of very high end titles sttuter like GTA 5 because of ram if you upgrade your ram to 12 gb or 16 gb then you will get the real performance of this lappy ....no frame drops after upgrading and handle 70% new games with 60fps ij high setting .....
46,5,In this price range this is better lappi and you can also option for upgrade your ram and also attached ssd for better performance but one demerit was processor 3350h if HP inbuilt 4600H processor this was AWESOME deal but over all performance was good . Display 5star Battery 5 star Processor 4star But if we attached SSD then speed and performance will increase but overall in this price range i will give 5 star after 20 days use ..
47,4,The product is best at this price ... The only con is it is a little bit slow because of hdd but can be corrected with 256 gb ssd ... So that will not be a big problem... Charging is very fast and battery life in normal usage is 4hours.... Overall good laptop
48,4,"I bought this laptop 7 days back and according to my, this laptop is pretty good .let me first talk about the design, so the design of this product very good and the performance of the battery is also nice but I don't like the keyboard because of the LED light you will not able to see the letters present on the keyboard and the final one is speed. In my case, the laptop speed is a little slow. If you add SSD then it will become more fast. so then thank you for reading my review."
49,5,"Boot time is a little slow but other than that I have know complains. Solid build quality, great screen, good speakers, respectable battery life, bang for the buck gaming performance. Overall very satisfied"
50,3,"The design and the user experience is best in class. But, it is quite slow. Even simple activities take longer time to respond. Also, would have been great if it had a Touch screen instead of a regular screen. Overall, I am happy except for these issues."
51,5,"Its been 2 weeks I am using the laptop, upgraded with 8 GB more RAM and it works like a charm, all the AAA titles of game runs smoothly on it - The game you name it and this beast will play it like charm, overall a great choice for official use also - For Work from home. To unlock the beast do upgrade with 8 GB ram and 240 GB SSD and it will run faster than any other laptop in this price range. Great value for money, Looks are awesome. Great choice."
52,5,pretty cool design the performance is really good the battery performance is good and it really charge very fast comparing to another laptops if you are seeing a laptop under 55k you can go for it
53,5,Amazing Laptop Loved it I upgraded the 256gb Western Digital Nvme SSD into it which make it's performance next level Booting time reduced from 40 seconds to 18 seconds. Recommended to install ssd to get real performance
54,5,Very nice laptop for students and office work better that Asus and Acer We can play game at High settings to get 60fps Battery is very nice and laptop charges in 30-60 min Display is fantastic
55,5,"Great gaming laptop in affordable price... Must buy for gaming lovers and content creators..   Pros: 1. Display is crisp and smooth 2. Processor 3. Upgradable with SSD upto 1tb and ram upto 32 gb  Cons: 1. Stock HDD is slow and it takes pc to start upto 3-4mins.(once I upgraded with WD SSD and copied the OS from HDD to SSD by WD disk cloning app, this problem cleared and takes me to windows within 10 seconds) 2. Games like GTA V can be played only when the laptop is connected to charger. Wh..."
56,5,Laptop is decent in terms of performance and gaming. Good display and processor for the price. Only con is less ram as integrated vega gfx eats 2gb so u get only 6gb. An additional 8/16gb RAM of 2666mhz speed from crucial can easily solve this problem. Also after 3-4 months the hdd will start acting up. This can be tolerated to some extent but if someone is looking to play games like Valorant or GTA 5 must upgrade to an 512GB SSD. Rest everything is working fine. Its a beautyüî•
57,4,"This is a good laptop.I played farcry 3,farcry 4 without SSD or ram upgrade.But BlueStacks lags.If you are a freefire player you can play lag free in smooth only.Charge don't last long.For gaming 10min it drops more than 20%.With charged only u get smooth fps.If u upgrade ram and SSD it may be good."
58,4,I write this review after using 10 days Design of laptop is excellent Especially display I loved it Battery is disappointing me Except battery all else fine If you are student then go for it Overall this is my first laptop so I love it One more thing performance is bit slow due to hdd If you want to play gt5 then you add ssd this boot your performance
59,4,"This is a decent gaming laptop, not recommended for high end gamers. However for casual gamers it's a nice option and performance is also good."
60,4,"The System is quite good in terms of processing power. The only problem is HDD, it takes ages to load anything. Be it booting or starting any heavy app. It takes a lot of time to run apps and to boot up. The same problem is true for most laptops with HDD as primary storage.  To overcome the long wait in boot time. I use the hibernate option provided by windows instead of shutdown. Hibernate keeps all your apps running and cuts of the power to the system. So the next time you turn it on, it's ..."
61,4,"Display and design are great hdd is slow i updated this ssd its very fast and battery is average but 150watt charges charges very quick, gaming performance while charger plugged is seamless i got it for RS.49240/- perfect deal im happy with it."
62,5,Awsome laptop. Only battery backup is a little lower but charges faster and windows 10 is genuine it is still awsome laptop.
63,4,"-Laptop looks great. -Display is awesome. -Those backlits are awesome man. We feel like watching the backlits turn-on the whole day. -Battery is below average to be frank. I get hardly 2:30 hrs backup. -Speakers are good, but not the best in this price rang e and especially when they mention B & Bo audio system, I expected more from it. -As it has only HDD, it's not that fast, it gets stuck at times but still manageable. -Graphics is good. I played Asphalt 9 legends.  Verdict: Go for it!üëç"
64,4,"Review after 3 months !! If you really want a good display laptop,just go for it. screen display is awesome than asus vivobook and mi notebook. If you want a performance and speed then you really need SSD. without that it is average. Just normal gaming and takes a bit second to open apps and games. Bit SSD will make it a beast !! Overall m happy with the beast üî• no other laptop has such feature in this range. 1. Display 5/5 2. Performance 4/5 (bcoz of hdd) 3. Speaker 4/5 (it's decent) 4. L..."
65,5,It's awesome product.. it's completely fast working process and multi short cut touch and design its ultimate like this laptop . I lived it ... battery backup generally good. Once you completely charged ur working continues online 5hrs I think. As per price the product its better then other laptop.  But design its fibler related plastic. Otherwise the product have supper product I like it product.
66,3,"Battery is pathetic, like I was getting free electricity in Delhi due to limited consumption, but this laptop sure gonna hike my electricity usage.  Laptop lags a bit , atleast 128 GB SSD should be given , and yes ram needs to get upgraded too , in order to have good performance.  Rest okayish product. For average usage."
67,5,"It is just awesome laptop good design, excellent display,nice graphics It is an awesome product I just loved it"
68,4,"I am satisfied with it at this price.Smooth performance even without ssd , backlight is just awesome I loved it.this is best for overall performance wheather you want to play game ,do editing , everything you can do smoothly.must buy it."
69,5,Awesome Product. Really fast and reliable. Haven't played any games yet but it pretty solid with multi tasking. Takes some time to start up the first time but then later its fine. I preferred Ryzen 5 over intel because of performance and it truly delivers that performance.
70,4,I bought this laptop far a week now.. it was soo cool and amazing performance for this price range.The only issue is with the booting time gets more time because of no ssd.. and the battery is pretty good for my usage..and for great performance there is a M.2 sad slot you can easy add ssd and run os on that ssd it will boot fast and fast processing üî•..

72,4,"this laptop needs some extra ram to be installed after purchasing as it is slow in many ways and if possible have some budget after buying it to upgrade it with a ssd and ram then it is a beast. over all build quality is very good. the matte finish make it looks classy but at the same time attracts everything including dust, fingerprints so it needs some pampering. The keyboard backlit is very awesome and is eye catchy , sound is awesome, screen resolution is just best. battery is average jus..."
73,5,One of tha Best laptop for Gaming and also for office work  Pros... Best performance Best display Best Sound Best design Best battery backup Beautiful backlit keyboard Trust of HP service  Put ssd and increase ram yourself.. Then this laptop will be Beast performance.  Cons.... Average webcam Boot time max 30sec... Only 5.9gb Ram available
74,4,Overall I like the laptop and perferably perfer this one.  Pros: 1. Speaker quality is good 2. LED quality is good and great display 3. Keybord is nice 4. Battery back is nice upto 3 hours without games. 5. Laptop build quality is nice. 6. Cooling is very well. 7. Camera quality is quiet well. 8. Processor is at their best  Cons: 1. There should be an SSD in place of HDD ( In this price tag ). 2. There is lagging problem while playing games on battery mode.
75,5,"Ok, first of all this is gaming laptop, so if you are looking for gaming purpose then it's absolutely for you. Now Talking about battery performance then it's as usual like for all gaming laptops. Only thing is it doesn't come with MS office licence key. Overall laptop is worth it...üí• Have a nice day..."
76,1,"Flipkart and hp, I'm really disappointed in both you with this slow lagging machine. I have seen so many videos that told me that this machine is a very good option but even after spending 55k rupees in this dabba. I'm not even able to use Chrome on it. It's that slow. Yes, not even Chrome. HP people are you sure, you are one of the best companies. You have made this lagging box, just so i can regret trusting you again. I thought maybe 55k is enough for me to get a decent laptop for daily use..."
77,4,Worth it guys go blindly for it but as its a gaming laptop battery backup is not nice but laptop design and other stuff are awesome
78,5,"Go for it , It is a budget friendly laptop with no issues.  You can upgrade in future :- 1)Ram (Upto - 32 GB,3200mhz)The information in product page is wrong. 2)SSD (NVMe)  Backlit keyboard is present at this cost only. The wifi is super fast also the bluetooth. The base speed of processor is 2.10ghz."
79,5,Best laptop for this type of specifications in this affordable price. And also good for Music quality.Display is good for quality videos . Performance is not so good.
80,5,"The only thing that I noticed is that it takes a little time to boot up. I have had used Lenovo before, beside being old it boots even taster than HP. Other than this I like all about it, when it gets little hot the two fans kicks in which makes me feel that I have a powerful machine. If you have more budget, then I would suggest you to go for Asus ROG. Which is too of the line product."
81,5,Good laptop with quite good display and features. Performance wise the processing is little slower than expected. Good buy at this price. Games run with good speed and efficiency.
82,4,This is best laptop for students. I really like keyboard and disin. Startup almost 10s. But super and amazing. Perfomance is specialy amazing. I konw ryzen is best than in intel.still i satisfied this product üòç
83,5,"This is my first higher price product that I bought from Flipkart. The seller was PETILANTE ONLINE. I was very much satisfied with overall everything. I literally have zero complaints. The package and the delivery was all perfect and genuine. Coming to the laptop, it's the BEST machine if you're looking for a great gaming and also for other miscellaneous purposes. I never thought that online shopping would be a bliss. Thank you, Flipkart."
84,2,"This review is after using for 1 week after installing all the updates and updating BIOS. This is a mediocre laptop. It just gets the work done. If you are purchasing this laptop, better get the SSD version or better get a SSD and upgrade RAM. The HDD version is really slow to boot up and takes 2-3 minutes after startup to function without stuttering. The initial 2-3 minutes after startup is really painful to use. My 2012 Dell laptop with HDD boots faster and can get to functioning properly ..."
85,4,I am writing this review almost a month After I have started using the product. As per the price it is an Ok quality of product. You can expect this quality of product for a range of 50k to 55k. I have got it on 48k inclusive of offers. Pros : 1.Got a very productive and effecient build quality. 2. Backlight Keyboard 3. Great 15.6 Inch Display. 4. Graphics card and Support 5. Rygen 5 Performance is great.  Cons : 1. No Microsoft life usability. It will ask you a license key. 2. Battery lif...
86,1,"Pathetic performance take ages to load the PC, had already replaced it once thought performance will be better in replaced version, it worked for a month now back to the same issue, booting takes a life to load? I also bought extended support with technician visit which does not work they want us to do all sorts of check by us before a technician visit can be arranged so pathetic support system. I won't recommend HP hardware."
87,4,"Its takes a several minutes when its starting for first time. but after that it runs smoothly. Also the specification of RAM given here is 8 gb, yes its true.. but for daily(normal usage) you can use only 6 gb. Rest 2 gb is reserved. The best thing is The display and trackpad.  the thing which I didn't liked is that, it only has 2 usb ports which sometimes feels short when multiple devices needs to be connected. Pros: Best Display best nvidia graphic card ryzen 5 chipset Compact attractive b..."
88,5,Good trending budget gaming configuration. HP has hit a jackpot in this category and it‚Äôs sales have seen a huge demand for the price point... more than Omen series. Can use it for Design softwares as well as heavy Gaming... serves well for both. AMD Ryzen series of processors wont disappoint you... trust me!
89,5,The laptop is just a beast. I loved the design of the laptop the speakers and the keys are the top quality. The battery of the laptop last well for normal usage for like 6 to 7 hours. I received the latest hp pavilion model the wifi is the best and it can connect to a wifi and a ethernet cable together at the same time you can enable this feature from the omen command center you can download it for free from the microsoft store the laptop performance is also good i am using this from last 10 ...
90,3,"System starts very slow sometime 12 - 13 minutes. Not happy with that, and if you want to use any good software or number of process then 8GB ( in that only 5.8GB usable its a Big Note to anyone who's is buying laptop because rest of it will be used for video card as per the laptop stands) is not enough.  But don't worry you can buy DDR4 8 GB ram and install so the laptop will be real fast and that might cost another 4.5k.  Overall I don't feel it's good to buy for 51k. Rather I would go for ..."
91,3,"So I waited a LONG time to write this review. I have been using this laptop for about 10 months now and I feel that it is pretty good. It smoothly runs almost every game, and it is great for coding. I use it for literally everything, and it is a great experience. However, using this thing in the first 2 months or so was like the biggest disappointment. It was slow as hell, games did not run properly, and the boot took forever (still takes a bit of time). I contacted HP Support multiple times ..."
92,5,Highly Satisfied and value for money Laptop   7 months since I purchased this laptop and it works perfectly . Boot time was more since it has only HDD but when i installed SSD everything is just matter of seconds . Also upgraded Ram to 16 GB only I confirmed with HP service executive that the laptop Ram can be expanded to 32GB.   I suggest to confirm the Ram capacity with HP service center before upgrading the Ram

104,5,The product is amazing it is must buy from the Flipkart if you want to buy a laptop it is very amazing and it seem as shown their and the functions is also amazing it is superb but the problem is that the battery is getting low in a very short time so this was on the problem otherwise the laptop is amazing

107,3,Battery performance is very awful...only 2 hours battery backup which is very irritating you have to charge it on every 2 hours which might be very disturbing for all of us and the performance is not so great ....apps like even simple apps take 5 min of time to open which is also very irritating and PC needs different types of updates time to time and it take 5 to 10 kin of time to open. Processor is good and graphic card and when you use PC for 4 to 5 hours it heats up like a very hot cooker...

110,5,excellent laptop with amazing looks and good price range. Just add a SSD to it and it's super fast.
111,4,"The hp pavilion gaming ryzen 5 laptop is a great option for a mix between business and gaming laptop. It has great design,good sound, great display.good battery and processor. The only downside is it doesn't come with a SSD which is a must for this laptop. It's a little slow without the SSD but since I had the SSD installed it's very fast. All in all a good buy at this price. Add 5k for SSD 500gb"
112,4,Design of the laptop is very good . Performance not that good because some high spec games like GTA 5 are lagging . Need to install a ssd and a 8 GB ram additional. But I think this is the best laptop in this price range as it offers Nvidia gtx 1650 . And also battery backup is also just ok not good .

114,3,I have been using this product for the last 10 days. So let me share my experience here.  -Its packing was great  -It has a decent screen.  -The backlight keyboard with violet color makes it quite attractive.  -speaker sound is good  -Battery backup is okay (even after using normal applications. Don't know if u play heavy games!!)  -webcam is great.  -this laptop is a bit slower & its booting time is more which makes it look like its lagging. It should be more faster as it has an AMD Ryzen 5 ...

120,5,Great laptop especially fans for cooling. Add another 8 gb of ram and an SSD and then it'll skyrocket like no other. Fans do their work exceptionally well as the most important job of a gaming pc is cooling the system. Which is performed best in this price bracket.
121,4,"the laptop is great, an excellent buy for students and gamers alike.  the cpu and gpu work great in gaming and video editing. display size and quality is excellent. the keyboard feels really tactile and good to use. one of the con i found about this laptop is out of the 8gb ram, only 6 gb ram is usable ( 2gb ram is reserved for the integrated graphics). so i reccomend adding another 8gb ram stick for the best performance."

And the laptop battery was also not too long for general purpose we can use it for 3-4 hours or sometimes even less. But I am happy with hp customer service because when my battery adapter failed to work they replaced it with new one.

127,3,The laptop itself is nice it can play most games at high graphics at 60fps i play total war troy which is a demanding game and it runs smoothly. The main problem arises when you start playing games like forza horizon 4 the game will run at 60fps ultra but due to very slow hdd and very low ram it will stutter. The laptop has 8gb of ram out of which 2.1 gb is hardware reserved for vega 8 graphics which itself is good and can handle most things on its own. After that the os will take futher 1-2 ...

JUST CLONE THE OS TO A SSD...THATS IT... IT'S A PERFECT BEAST... AND THE HDD IS NOT AS DUMB AS PEOPLE SAY.... REMOVE MANY STARTUP PROGRAMS IN MSCONFIG AND ENABLE QUICK BOOT IN BIOS...

Although latest high end games like Devil May Cry 5 (2019) takes quite a toll on the ram often causing the game to lag if played for longer duration so my recommendation is to play latest high end games for less duration about 2 hrs not more than that.

158,1,Only purchase it if you're ready to spend at least 5-6k more on adding additional RAM and SSD. Without SSD it's dead slow. And you'll need additional RAM to play games as AMD keeps 2.1 gb RAM reserved so you get only 5.8 GB RAM available which is too low.

160,5,Very nice product in this price range.
161,1,One of the least efficient thing I have bought from. Flipkart no doubt packaging is quite good But performance of laptop. Is mil. It's boot time is 3-4 times future We have to wait for 2-3 mins for google chrome or microsoft edge to start I think this is not gaming laptop this is waiting laptop all time just we have to. Go on waiting
162,5,Great performance but there is need to add a SSD for boost in the performance.Got the order after a delay than expected delivery date but product wasn't damaged.Product was intact.Overall nice future proof product.

166,2,Performing worse than my expectaions. Even my Dell Latitude 3400 works faster and smoother than this.
167,3,1) Real daily boot time is 4 minutes atleast. Don't expect to boot in 1 minute. 2) lags a little while using from first day. Opening of apps is not that fast. 3) hdd used in it is of toshiba company. Hdd is not good its speed is slow. 4) comes with mcafee antivirus of only 1 month. 5) ADDITIONAL RAM AND SSD IS MUST in this laptop !!!
168,5,Must Buy. Excellent product. Value for money.
169,2,"So this rating is for the laptop which comes in original condition without ssd. Before ssd laptop was performing below average and HP bloatware was dragging the performance down. So I installed a new wd ssd and migrate os in that ssd. Now the performance is improved alot. Machine boots in 7 to 10 seconds, copying speed is 22mbs/sec. And I am happy.  Laptop body is fingerprint magnet.  Recommendation- if anyone wants to buy this product install ssd in it. You will be happy."

177,5,Today i have received the laptop..Thanks for flipkart team.. and we will write review the laptop workings after 15 days
178,5,"Don't buy the cheap words of people saying that it is a fraud of something. It is expected for radeon vega 8 to cover up 2 GBs of your ram. I've played cs go, fifa 21,etc and there wasn't much of heating issue. If you are a typical gamer, you should go for a higher laptop. I've got work of programming and modelling, and this product provides satisfaction. You could always a stick of RAM and M.2 nvme SSD for more performance any time you want."
179,5,a personal suggestion extend ram with one more 8 gb stick otherwise gta V lags alot
180,4,Over all Good.... Windows opening speed is low.. may be due to no SSD Thanks fr all trial version software development
181,4,"It's a good laptop you can play games in medium or low settings it can give you around 60 fps,but don't expect High quality gaming with High frame rate,Also if you upgrade the ram and add ssd to it you can increase its performance,the display quality and viewing angles are also good, overall it's a good laptop for its price"

185,5,Asowm
186,5,Very good product and less price
187,4,It's a handy laptop for both performance and style. I have been using for a month now and I have zero issues with any of the spec or nuances around the laptop. Ryzen's quad core sure helps keep cpu usage below 50% even during hard core coding moments while I have 20+ tabs open chrome 2-3 heavy developer softwares running simultaneously and Spotify plays music. I have not played games with it so I'm not in a position to talk about the gaming aspects of the laptop.

200,4,The start up time seem to be a bit higher than usual where as the specs should be reducing the time to start. Initially I got a start up time of 20-25 sec to Login Screen .. which was really good. however it seems to be a bit slow now a days. Unsure of the reasons. Battery back is good. Display is beautiful. Very less heating issue. Gaming is good. Haven't done extensive gaming though. In-Built apps helps a lot.
201,1,This laptop is too too slow from 1st day.
202,1,"The worst investment done by me till date, the product is not at all upto the mark. It is said to be gaming laptop but it has problem of freezing you can't do work as well. Its my worst experience till now in all the laptop i have been used. And if you are going to buy laptop please don't buy ryzen go for another processor."
203,5,"I have used this laptop for a month, the windows that installed on hard disk is very heavy hence booting time is very high, i have reinstalled the deafult windows with bootable pendrive,now its fine for use ,now it take 15 to 20 sec to boot, performance in improved after reinstallation of windows."
204,5,My first laptop purchase and it was the best. Yes off course it is slow but it is nothing that can be solved by an SSD a mere 120gb m.2 nvme can change this laptop a ultimate beast. I play Resident evil 7 and Batman Arkham Knight both perform very well in 1080p Max settings.
205,5,It's all things is good but battery backup is written there 5 hours but it not it's battery backup is is only 3 and half hours
206,3,"The laptop is slow! Really really slow. And this, without any new applications installed. Disappointing performance."
207,5,Awesome laptop
208,5,Just spend 5-7k extra to upgrade RAM and SSD and see your dreams come true
209,3,"Using this laptop for a week. Here are some things I noticed. Positive points:  Display is value for the money. Design is great, body looks awesome. After effects and GTA V runs like charms.  I do graphic design and rendering using Blender and it works fine I have no complains so far   Negative points: Cyberpunk lags so I had to uninstall. Problem in loading large Blender files Lag issues in using big graphic intensive software. Startup takes time, maybe buy an SSD version.  Not sure..."
210,4,"Been 4 months since I got this laptop and must say its been very impressive PROS are the price, the monitor(keep in mind I haven't seen a lot of other IPS monitors), the keyboard, The speakers(amazing) Build quality-made of plastic, but the plastic has a good feel Unique design Actually good selection of ports  CONS The above mentioned plastic is good, but it loves getting smudged and picks up fingerprints  HDD can sometimes be surprisingly slow in game loading 8GbB RAM but obv 2GB of th..."
211,5,Laptop is superb.....ü§ûüî•ü§ô All laptop's give battery backup upto 3-4hrs. That laptop also gives same battery backup. I liked it's thermal cooling system. As the temperature increases the fan spped is increase. Cooling system is superbüî•üî• Design and overall other things are also good.
212,4,Performance is okay. Sound quality is superb. Display is good. The main disappointment is battery. Battery is draining fast

215,5,Awesome in this price range
216,4,Good üëçüòé
217,3,It was good but sometimes apps like blender and fusion 360 are not responding I don't know exactly what the problem is but I downloaded the apps with lisence but why the are not responding nad battery backup is not up to the mark I think it should be get more backup and charging speed is okay..
218,4,Overall the laptop is good but after using it for 5 days the booting time is very slow but the games run good I would suggest you to go for extra 8gb ram and 250gb ssd.

Update- Pros Working fine 1. battery is still good on normal usage gives 7 hours backup and I don't play games on battery will not recommend anyone to do so plug in then play. 2. Hinges and keys are still in amazing state. 3. Thermal give good cooling. 4. Gets fully charged in 1 hour 45 minutes even is you are using it.  Cons 1. Thermal's outlets vent throws half of the hot air directly ...
266,5,SETISFIED IN THIS PRISE :-)
267,1,Worst product ever and i had a worst very bad experience ordering with flipkart the customer care is not helpfull . No one ever listens to the customer
268,4,I got this for 45.5k using card offer best in that price.add SSD 256gb 3.5k and the laptop is beast
269,5,Best laptop in this range with Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650
270,5,Working great. No lag. Quality good
271,5,You should go for nvme ssd hardware or u can upgrade this then it would be beast
272,4,Looks great n after use of some time I add my review
273,5,It was fantabulous inthis price range.The display and sound quality of this laptop is top-notch but little bit slow down which is negligible.Good battery backup and backlit keyboard.Iam happy with this.
274,4,Good For the decent Gaming And other user stuff...But cannot run highEnd Games smoothly without The Frame drops...unless You upgrade The Ram.
275,5,Awesome product
276,5,After ssd it is a beast goo for it
277,5,Mind blowing lappy.... I highly recommend just go for it....
278,5,Better to put SSD in it
279,4,"At first it didn't go well,Then I put an SSD, now it's going wellüòä"
280,4,"After 1 week of use my impression:  Perfomence: Laptop is slow compared to others devices at this range, maybe performance will be better after installation of ssd and increasing ram.  Battery: battery backup is descend. I will fully review this after a month or so.  Design: Design is really impressing.  Keyboard & trackpad: keyboard quality is good but trackpad is descend.  I will cover full review after a month or so."
281,1,"Updated review.  Motherboard and battery replaced by HP. Charging is an issue. While using the system, it won't charge. Shutdown and it charges. Bad product  HDD doesn't help. It's slow than slowest. Upgraded with SSD and it became lightning fast. Make the SSD primary drive with OS installation. HDD can be back up one."
282,5,"Good build quality Apart from HDD, everything is great. User can purchase SSD or buy SSD variant for more speed."
283,5,"It's a really great product, I would say go for it and it is also upgradable, so u can buy it if you want a lap for 4-5 years.  Till 1TB SSD can be installed And also extra 8GB ram can be installed (In total 16 GB)."
284,5,I got the 4 days ago this product is value for money buy it this is great deal and at this price this is beast laptop and plus point is Nvidia graphics card 1650 I love this product

294,5,"Best laptop in this range Got at 46k only. Played Valorant without facing any problem Need to add SSD for rough usage, otherwise no problem in normal use with HDD."

296,4,"I got this laptop only in 47,000 .... I am so happy with this product (till now) Battery last long about 5-6 Hr in normal video streaming"
297,2,"Performance is average, and the gaming performance too is not so good. I tried to install gta 5 and ith lags like hell even at low settings. The battery backup is also so poor."
298,1,"Utterly disappointed It literally takes 2.50 min to boot up and another 50 sec for system to set up. Even after read all the comments about its worst performance I made up mind to buy it and hoped I can manage. Now I feel how stupid I was. I am regretting everything now. What I have done to my self!!? It is very slower than my i3 laptop with 2 gb ram. I know SSD WOULD HAVE MADE IT FASTER, BUT REALLY DUDE THIS IS AMD RYZEN 5 WITH 8GB RAM COMMON ON!!!!.what will be more worse than having 8gb ra..."
299,4,Pros: Performance is really good Excellent configuration for the given price  Cons: Poor build quality No pre-installed MS office Battery last long for max of 5hrs unlike hp is claiming like 8hrs
300,3,Worst customer care experience. Even after 6 days of my complaint HP was even unable to find what causes the problem and I am still waiting for an explanation from them.
301,5,The laptop is an absolutely power package for the given price range and runs most games at a decent pace . Gta v has encountered a frame rate lag but runs almost smooth when service priority set high and framerate at 40fps. The absence of an ssd and an higher ram is an disappointment but the upgradable slots are a counter to the issue with an additional expense of 10grand will make up for an 1tb ssd with another 8gb ram . Overall very satisfied with product
302,5,Nice to handle
303,4,This could have ssd card for faster operation and not having disc drive.
304,4,"Only 2 usb slots provided which is disappointing, battery backup is just ok sustainable not that great. Display is ok doesn't have a full HD vibe. Overall a good one."
305,3,Low battery backup upto 3.5hrs for normal usage
306,4,Laptop is overall value for money and u can play GTA V like games in very high settings. The main problem Im facing is its performance issue.but after installing SSD and Ram this laptop is working very smoothly u won‚Äôt regret after buying it. And finally the Thermals of the laptop @ max temp during GTA V was 84 degree and that is quite good so this laptop is very in thermals also u can play 4-5 hours continuously. üëç
307,4,It an good machine but one must add SSD before or after using it(without SSD it pretty much slow) SSD slot is available(M.2)
308,5,Great quality and good looking device.
309,5,Its amazing laptop with 55k budget..... Awesome experience with gaming..... Battery backup is good..
310,4,Everything is okay but sime times it got slowness as 2 GB RAM out of 8 GB RAM is already locked by system....just getting 20 to 30 seconds hanging
311,5,Best in price but must add SSD
312,5,Must buy product and amazing gaming beast at this price
313,3,Awesome product.
314,5,Nice one but require ssd

317,5,Perfect device in this price range
318,1,"Don't even think to play warzone with this laptop, it just hangs up and you'll be taking an year to come back to home screen."
319,5,HP IS GREAT FOR LAPTOP AND PRINTER
320,4,Totally good.. U always need charger for avoid lag and battery draining while playing gta 5 and other high games.. Also u need to add ssd. For better perfomence.. 8gb ram. But 5gb available.. Design and backlit is very good... Best value in money..
321,5,Little lagging problem otherwise everything is good üëçüèª
322,5,"Nice laptop in this range.. only one thing that the Laptop Speed is not great as per our expectations, but after update bios and Windows OS Speed increase from than previous speed...."
323,5,Better version but for better performance u need to update ssd
324,4,Everything is good but they are not giving SSD.. Almost all companies are giving SSD in this price..
325,5,"I have used this laptop for more than one month and have not faced a single issue in it..I have played gta 5, did video editing in premiere pro, coding, used Adobe Photoshop and everything was working absolutely fine.. But if you want more smooth exotics l experience you can just upgrade the ram to 16gb and this laptop will become beast.."
326,5,Amazing laptop and a pure beast at this price segment. No lag or heating issues and battery lasts easily for 4 hours on normal usage. Got it within a day and far above my expectations. Just add an m2 SSD and additional 8 GB 2400 MHz RAM and it'll be the best thing ever.
327,5,"I edited my review after the heavy use like(working on Revit Architecture software).After installing Revit I especially feel it is laggy but if you add SSD then it works fine. Takes time for opening after shut down thats why I keep my pc on sleep mode in day time and shut down only in night. I expected little more in this price range becoz if you invest 55k money in any pc and you will feel disappointed with its functionality,, it is not fair."

339,5,"Best Laptop, I got it for 48897 Good graphic performance feels a bit slower because of AMD Ryzen 5 3550H and no ssd alongwith. display is good battery backup is good sound quality is average It is a light weight laptop around 1.8 kgs looks very stunning"

342,1,The worst purchase I ever made
343,4,"This is a value for money laptop. I bought it for video editing and boy it does the job so nicely. And I think it's targeted for that exact group, because I think for really high end game it will run short especially with only 6 GB allocated memory. It does take bit long to reboot and you won't find any high performance in normal day to day tasks. But in high end tasks like video editing it comes to life and takes 10% time of what it used to be in my older laptop. I got it at 49k, I think it'..."
344,3,After one year the system becomes very slow. Initial starting take 3 minutes. Opening and closing application too slow. Low performing laptop
345,3,"Please don't buy this product, performance is very bad. Start and shut down is taking too much time.We will go mad."
346,1,Worst laptop ever it started lgaing from day one and can't run basic games very slow and worst performance you expect from a gaming laptop. My money is wasted and now I can't return it. I am stuck with it . Please dont the mistake I did.
347,5,"I was sceptical before buying, but I received a brand new stock, Jan 2021 in February itself. The packing itself was untouched from factory. We bought two, and I asked my daughter about the performance, she gave everything 5 stars and for battery 4 stars. Overall we are happy about the purchase after using it for over a month."
348,4,I am using this laptop for 5 months now. It is incredibly good have also give me 140+FPS during gaming. I mostly plays Valorant and it really runs well. But sometime it performs slow whenever i open up any IDE for coading. I am a CS Student and i like to code a lot but sometimes it lags during debugging and compilation of the code. Maybe its because of SSD. I will edit my Review after I install a ssd in it. Maybe after a month or two.
349,5,Beast Product Tested FALL GUYS - 61-75 FPS ON HIGH SETTINGS MINECRAFT - 50-61 FPS ON FANCY SETTINGS NO LAG GTX 1650 IS BEAST RYZEN 5 3550H IS ALSO GOOD
350,5,Good Laptop for gaming and software coding  Pros Backlight keyboard 6Gb graphic card amd + Nvidia 2 ram slot 1 used and 1 in free Amd Ryzen gaming chip  Cons No ssd so we can add ssd also Only 6 gb ram When installing heavy game cpu get 100% so laptop get hanged
351,4,Performance is good and look is awesome but sometimes the hing is producing sound in turbo mood
352,5,Just awsoom Looks 10/10 Performance best Sound awesome Just love with pavilion
353,5,Product was good and there is no doubt about Flipkart. I am very happy with this product.
354,4,"4 star is only for in this price they can add a 120gb ssd. Because of hdd machine is lagging to much, response time is high. Others all good."
355,4,The only problem is ram. I was only provided with 6gb of ram and there is no option in bios to free the ram. Else every thing is good.
356,1,Very very slow.worst product from hp.

372,4,Best laptop@48465/- i just fall in love with this beast one!!!!!!!
373,4,Good if you extend ram and ssd
374,4,Except battery all features are good.

377,4,Best laptop for gaming after upgrading 16 gb ram Because very lag in gta 5
378,5,Perfect Laptop for gaming! must bye
379,5,"The laptop was super awesome, but just one little problem, there is no screw to install SSD, they must need to provide screws for SSD. I collected one from old laptop, but had to use sandpaper to reduce the screw length. And also added a washer to hold it in place"
380,4,Really Satisfied ‚ò∫Ô∏è
381,4,Add ssd worth 3-5 k and it's beast at this price range Btw adding ssd do not violate the hp warranty
382,5,"Awesome product, amazing speed n performanceü§©üëå"
383,5,Very gud product
384,5,Nice but login slow
385,5,Good working
386,4,"Gaming performance is great but other than gaming, it's slow because it doesn't come equipped with SSD. If you can extend your budget go for SSD variant directly or you can just buy this one and install it later."
387,4,Performance isn't consistent . I think this may be due to processor or the updates for windows 10. Definitely needs SSD minimum 256gb coz the laptop feels incomplete without it . For consistency on performance and reduce the application load time or boot time. The way things are right now it's walking needs SSD to run.
388,5,This laptop can be bought only when you can afford another 10K on SSD and RAM upgrade. Otherwise don't go for it.
389,3,The Laptop is Very Slow(Installed Photoshop & coral) .. Need to add SSD in it...
390,5,Best one

392,5,U should definitely purchase this laptop as its a budget one... It does hav many features but i got the issue of booting time and slow opening of apps..... After that update it to your latest version and the laptop will work smoothly
393,4,"Everything is good but probably the worst HDD installed. You cannot game even when you get a perfect FPS because it takes time to load and retrieve the data from your hard disk. But for this price, if in case you have installed an SSD which costs around 5k for 500GB M.2 nVme then you can game or do something productive with no issues.  So an extra 5k is required unless you do not want to hard gaming on this.  The plus in this laptop is even when you game a lot with sufficient space and venti..."
394,1,Worst product from HP don't buy this one very very slow
395,3,"Major draw back is booting time takes little bit long ,and sometimes touch pad wouldn't work properly"
396,5,"Used it over an year.. Still running awesome. I am able to play games like Horizon Zero Dawn, Cyberpunk in high quality without any lags. Will recommend to add 8 gb ram more as it has 1 empty ram slot"
397,5,"Writing a review after 1 week usage. I am a surgeon by profession, needed a laptop for presentations, paper writing, some video editing. Design is terrific, gives a classy, techy look...especially the built quality, finish and backlit keyboard. This product is absolutely rocking performance wise... Intially it was lagging a bit then I updated the drivers. It started firing then, It's a complete setup for academic n educational purposes. If more needed I'll upgrade the ram n ssd..."
398,5,Best for 3D work
399,2,Never buy this laptop with hdd it's slow like tortoise
400,5,"Very good laptop. At first it's very slow, but you should add ram and ssd and then it's very fast. I added ram and ssd and now the booting time is around 10 secs. Very good laptop after upgrade."

405,5,Take more time to booting bcz of low rpm than normal HDD Only 5.9GB Ram is usable Sound is Good Good performance
406,4,It's a budget laptop. It has fullfilled all my requirements from playing fifa 20 to coding and installation of appium.
407,5,Bad
408,4,After purchasing the laptop it's speed was slow. Due to high graphics you will get 6 gb ram. And don't even think of playing high quality games without upgrading your laptop. But after 15 days of purchase... I bought a 8 gb ram and 256 gb ssd... After upgrading my laptop became very fast.... So u must spend additional 8k rupees for upgradation !!!
409,1,"very slow, buy ssd or don't buy at all"
410,5,"Value for money... After few setups and updates, it's working very smoothly. Battery backup is also good. Camera is also good . Sound system is quite satisfying."
411,4,Laptop is very good.. looking good.. design good...but it lags sometime...and it is slower than expected üò£üòî..So if You want a beast performance then upgrade it's ram and SSD... Battery is average...and this is my dream laptop..and now I have this dream ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
412,3,"The laptop is so good for doing ur daily works or multitasking and all. The only problem is i can't play games in this it starts to lag and there is a big fps drop. I don't know why it is happening. If anyone could please give me a proper ans, how to repair this problem i would be really greatful."
413,4,"Good laptop, But little bit slow. Looks like using an old gen computer.( I think this is making it slow ""New tech on old hardware type hddüòÖ)So I'll upgrade it lateron . All are saying that will make the performance much faster. I'll update the review afterwards"
414,2,This laptop is vary slow please go for ssd version
415,3,It is good but my delivery boy was very rude
416,5,This product is too good.... Must putchase it.
417,1,"it working very slow , we have to add ssd to working properly, without ssd it is useless"
418,5,Best laptop for College students
419,4,Best laptop for students
420,4,Best laptop in th 50000
421,5,"Superb amazing product, 100% worthy. I bought it for 50000. But remember to buy an ssd. Battery life is up to 3 to 4 hr."
422,5,. So its not a major problem because it has Hdd in it if you install ssd in it will be faster and their will be no lag
423,3,"It takes around 30 seconds to boot, takes time to open any application so overall response time is somewhat more than expected. It doesn't feel today's generation laptop while using."
424,5,Overall laptop is very good but will need add a ssd to it and remember to update your graphic card drivers
425,3,Just need to add sdd and ram then it wll be beast
426,5,"This is the best laptop I've ever bought in my life till now. The only lack I feel is that they didn't provide MS office full version for permanent. They've a trial version of very short duration. Now even needs to buy the software separately, I feel the extra expense."
427,3,IF YOU HAVE MORE MONEY THEN GO FOR SSD MODEL OF THIS LAPTOP. THE HDD IS VERY SLOW AND SOMETIMES IT'S PERFORMANCE CRASHES. YOU CAN SEE LAGS AND THE BOOT TIME IS SLOW. RAM IS NOT SUFFICIENT AS PER THE GAMING LAPTOP. 2GB RAM IS RESERVED ALREADY FOR AMD RADEON GRAPHICS. WHEN YOU SEE THE TASK MANAGER THEN YOU WILL DISCOVER THAT ONLY AROUND 3GB OF RAM IS USABLE. IF YOU WANT TO PLAY AAA GAMES LIKE GTA5 AND FARCRY THEN DON'T EXPECT IT TO RUN WITHOUT ANY LAGS AND SHUTTERING. OVERALL THE LOOK AND DISP...
428,1,Very poor performance... takes almost an hour to start That too after restarting after 4-5 times Very slow  Worst laptop ever experienced
429,5,"After one month of Laptop , i felt it is value for money. Only one trouble is that booting time is little longer. If we add a PCIe NVMe card this problem should get resolved"
430,5,"Best in its class. Ram & SSD upgrade is a must other than that no issues, battery üîã is fine ."
431,4,When system is starting than it will much slow open and its performance is also slow otherwise it was best its better also good
432,5,Best laptop at this Price range
433,5,Best at this price
434,5,Simply superb !!
435,5,This is a worth product at this price..... Such a nice performance it has
436,5,"After using 3months I'm posting my review.... simply it's awsm.... If u r looking laptop for design, coding, gaming etc.... go for it..."
437,4,Need to upgrade SSD for smooth but performance with hdd is good for low end users
438,4,Great product . But if possible get yourself a SSD and 8gigs of extra RAM then you will enjoy it at its full capacity. HDD is too slow. And other than that it felt value for money.
439,5,All features are very good ..but battery backup only problem ..less time working
440,5,Good
441,5,Just wow
442,5,In price approx 50000 the product is very good and performance is also good.
443,4,It would be a 5star product if it has more battery life . It ran out of battery in high performance however can cope up with it in battery saver mode

497,3,"I recently purchased this laptop and getting very good performance but having heating issue on right side of keyboard panel and left side of heating vents downside which is more than usual. This thing bothers me that you touching your laptop and feel heat. Otherwise all other things are good.  Heating isn't a small issue which you can ignore. It troubles you everytime you use your device. I've no option to return, only replacement is acceptable which worth nothing to me because I think the wh..."
498,5,"Genuine product, trust worthy."
499,4,Overall happy
500,5,Good product.....you can go for it
501,5,It is best laptop for gaming
502,5,Every thing is fine but slightly slow due to without ssd and extra ram
503,4,"After 1 week of usage. Should have gone for SSD is the only drawback. There's another slot for expansion, which is a good option. No lag issues and maximum boot time is between 2 - 3 seconds which is good for HDD these days. Ryzen 5 is just out of the box. Battery life is also good. We can manually enable 4K with AMD settings on the system."
504,3,Not for value for money
505,2,I think it is refreshing
506,2,"Sent a defective laptop after placing an order it took just 4 days to deliver the product but when I applied for returns its been 8 days still the product is with me, the procedure to return anything is pathetic product is good only need to install an ssd for better percormance"
507,5,"Great Machine, Got it for 52k on sale and it is worth every penny, played Doom, Doom Eternal, GTA V, Just Cause and other great titles without even a single lag. go for it without a second thought :)"
508,5,Excellent Performance with this affordable price
509,4,U have to add SSD for better performance. When i switched it on performance was not good as i expected. Bought 250 GB Kingston additional SSD. Now it's good.
510,1,Extremely Slow and poor performance! The specifications look impressive only on paper but the falsely hyped Laptop is extremely disappointing. It takes over 4 minutes to boot and several seconds to open applications. The battery life is around 1.5 hours so you have to rely on constant power to continue working. HP support is not impressive because the customer service team isn't technically qualified to resolve common issues. Would strongly advise against buying HP laptops.
511,5,Fantasticüòç
512,4,It's nice product
513,5,Please provide atleast 128 gb SSD for fast boot .One of the best laptop and gorgeous look.
514,4,Good but little bit slow if you used ssd than it will be okay

525,5,"Ok , nice Product under 50k range , but please increase your packing quality , this type of packing is not suitable for 50k item"
526,4,It is very good at performance and also best for gaming at this price If you want to buy dont think just go for it.
527,3,Performance not so good without ssd so i prefer to say must buy ssd for it.

536,5,Good for gaming and Web designing but it takes little more time to start and shutdown
537,5,One of the best laptop in this price segment(around 52k). Display is awesome. Just install any 256/512GB nvme SSD and it's performance would change drastically! Overall AMD Ryzen 5 3550H is a good processor for casual gamers.
538,3,Poor quality of Flipkart packing

544,4,good. but noticed lags in it .
545,4,you can purchase it without any hesitation
546,4,Use SSD for even more better performance
547,5,best gaming laptop
548,5,You definitely need a SSD card if you buy this laptop. It has 2.1GHZ processor. If you buy this laptop for gaming than go for 3.1GHZ processor in this category or install a SSD card. Otherwise it will work Slow. Just that processor is slow otherwise it's good laptop to buy.
549,2,I am Android developer running Android studio taking lot of ram also sound problem if I run my emulator making sound not run properly waste of money don't buy it
550,3,Booting time is high.. I recommend to add an SSD and move windows to it. Otherwise nice laptop for entry level gaming and editing...
551,3,Battery life is too bad
552,5,Good laptop for this price

556,3,This is a good product In terms of value for money. But I face a problem which is Slow boot. I write this review after 4 month Continue use. Go for it But Mind it Insert a Ssd for batter experience

558,5,Good laptop at all üòäü§üüí•üî•üíØ
559,5,"The only major issue is battery backup ,which can be seen in all the gaming laptops . But once you connect it to a charger then you will get the real beast out of it . Considering the price, the laptop delivers great performance and quality of the product is very good. Total graphical memory is 5 gb ( 4gb From Nvidia+1 gb from RAM ). I'll recommend you all to upgrade your pc with an ssd of 250gb and a ram of atleast 4gb"
560,3,Am graphic designer. After using 1 month of photoshop. Lot of hang issues. So any one buy for designing purpose. Go for Ssd version. Not this. But apart from designing. It's really good.. üòá‚úåÔ∏è. Im telling only for designing people's. Not everyone.

589,4,everything is good in this price range.. just U have to add an extra 8gb ram to run smoothly.. no other choice.. extra around 2500 rs for ram... and u should know that 2gb ram already reserved for system usage.. it means even if u upgrade the ram upto 16 gb still u can use only 14gb... just mind it before buying it.. and it matters.. üòï and while charging the charger getting heated so much.. I dont know it only happens to me or others too..
590,1,"Some games are lagging , i dont know why this is happening. I am not impressed regarding this product. Build quality is not good . heat control is no doubt good. Battery average. Charging cable is too small.. No colours variety is available, disgusting black Colour."

The battery life is very low and the 8 GB ram, we provided by 5.8 GB on which we used and the other 2.2 GB is locked for hardware. Due to lack of ssd this laptop is slow working and boot time about 25-35 sec.  But overall this laptop is great."

621,5,Purchased for my younger son. He is absolutely happy. So I got the value of purchase.
622,5,Great Display and Sound quality .  Overpowered gaming but only problem is that the usable RAM is 5.92 GB.  You can add RAM and the AMD Ryzen 5 is a total beast .  Love the finishing and overall 4.5/5

627,5,nice
628,5,Fantastic product with fantastic price point...
629,5,"Very nice,, ???"
630,1,"I dont know what the issue is but the performance is very very poor,the booting takes almost 45sec,games are unplayable,also it crashes a lot. For some weird reason the usable ram i get is only 5.88 gb out of 8gb. Opted for the return option,but weirdly flipkart has only replace option,that too with only the same product. My friend just bought the same product,he is facing the same issue! Update:- received the replacement unit, still a shitbox,slow af,i guess the whole lot is defective"
631,1,The main reason for giving just one star is nothing but their amd on board gpu which reserves 2gb of the total ram in the system which seriously affect the gaming performance. Overheating is another issue.
632,1,performance too much slow. don't buy this product .it's waste of money
633,1,The product is not good with 6 gb ram but if you add another 8 gb of ram and 256 gb of ssd then it is a beast.
634,5,Very slow processor
635,2,Takes too long to start... High graphic games lag
636,2,cant play gta 5 smoothly with this 6gb ram a lot of lag occuring
637,1,Battery back up has been reduces to 2 hrs with in 2 weeks and laptop charge rate is 6% per hour
638,5,4days of USAGE AND in short. This laptop can be used for multitasking(coding apps) and runs fairly smooth...boot time approx 45secs and build is amazing. But there is a sluggish and conventional old laptop feels from the start..Its is kind of slow and in the promotion of the laptop benchmark says COD WARFARE runs at ultra high but the laptop doesn't even run the game smoothly like lobby and all...Gaming experience is bad when its online. Have already updated my bios and all but its pretty bad.
639,1,"screen bleeding issue noted, i return"
640,4,Due to the hdd... it's boot time and app opening time is slow but overall it's ok for a budget gamer.... The design is awesome as a gamming laptop but the top flex is visible. Built of the top is slightly disappointing. But the overall the built quality is ok. The huge disappointing thing in this laptop is that the usable ram is only 5.4GB out of 8 gb I'm very disappointed for that.
641,2,"I wanted to write this review because there are couple of things not worth.  1 Design is awesome. 2 Sound is awesome. 3 Display is awesome. 4 Performance disappointed me, I bought the laptop two days back and it‚Äôs hanging many times. Even before checked game performance. single HD movie also hanged many time in two hours.  Before buying this laptop please check other laptops in this price range and compare with hardware."
642,1,Very slow laptop
643,1,Don't buy this model. Boot time is above 3 min and the laptop is laggy
644,1,The Laptop is good But the Service of Flipkart is extremely poor
645,2,"I purchased this Laptop looking at all the reviews, and also after going through expert comments and reviews on different websites. I really like the design, look and aesthetics of the Laptop.  However, when it comes to performance, I am terribly upset with the boot speed. I understand this doesn't have an SSD, but even with a Hard Disk, that too with the specs that his Laptop comes with, taking close to 2 minutes or more to get to the Windows 10 logon screen is too much. Moreover after loggi..."
646,1,I had buy this laptop just some days before. And I'm very much regretted. The battery takes too long time to charge like 3% takes 30 minutes. And the laptop is very very slow and taking too much time to start. And if you play any game it lags very much or even in between game the laptop gets lock. Very disappointed.
647,1,Worst product ever I got this product just 4 days ago and after installing GTA V I am getting an fps of only 40 on avg. And on contacting Hp support and Nvidia they just give you steps again n again but none of them work and the settings are NORMAL and all the things are updated. Buy only if you don't have any problems in your life
648,1,Please don't purchase it because after finding lots of diificulties when I talked to the HP customer care they told me that windows is not provided by them may be flipkart has given windows 10 means hp has provided with simple docs nothing.  Actually I purchased this laptop after reading all the review but what I observed it a very slow battery is ok only and screen gets freezes I think about 50 times with in only 20days and boot up issue. Takes about 1 to 2 minutes to start the laptop after...

Windows home edition does not have ms office which is needed for any student: misleading information by Flipkart/ HP as they should specify. 2. Computer booting takes considerable time feel that I should have taken SSD rather than 1 TB HDD, seems a bit slow in response (maybe due to Ryzen 5 processors when compared to i5) 3.

651,1,DONT BUY THIS...........its very very slow Sometimes it freeze for no reason It take atleast 1 min to startup Cant even shutdown the system  NOT SATISFIED AT ALL
652,1,Booting time is too long even with min loading apps. Apps loading time is also too long. Battery drains too fast.
653,1,Worst laptop of all time. Very slow and battery was a useless and causing issue within 15 days of buying

659,4,Everything is fine best performance but battery drains fast
660,1,Performance is slow
661,4,Best laptop
662,1,Just to sell the ssd they make made this hdd thing a joke.. If u r willing to spend about 10 K more then only buy this one otherwise find something else. The boot up time and the performance it gives is jst unacceptable. Even opening Google Chrome takes ages
663,3,Man this is one of the best but of your gaming in this laptop. 8 gb ram is not enough you have to upgrade to 16 gb ram or directly buy same laptop with 16 gb ram and the most value for money in this laptop is graphics card
664,1,"Don't waste your money on this ,I am writing this review after 1month of usage, it crashes almost every time ,can,t even watch YouTube on chrom properly , always crashesh, I buy this laptop for gaming and video editing, now I am regretting ü•≤,PLZZ don't buy this"
665,1,It is worst phase and you can say experience of online shopping there is nothing which justify its cost and specifications.This is also a old model so u can buy some new arrivals of any company with great experience.
666,1,Always if you open any program it will show not responding not responding
667,3,"bootup time is around 2 min, horribly slow system"
668,3,If you are really into gaming and want to buy a high performance laptop do not buy it. Never ever go for Ryzen. I won't suggest you ever. I am writing this honest review after using it for a month. Do not buy it.
669,1,Disgusting service from Flipkart and HP.....they stuck my money......third class product they sell
670,2,"A gaming laptop, which cannot survive browser tabs more than 5, while simple apps are running in the background (Spotify, Trello, Telegram)."

676,2,Please not buy this üôèüèªin 5days it have lots of issues worest battery slow boot time
677,3,Little slow it's giving me reminder of first generation pc black and white once
678,2,Booting Takes Much time (more than 5 min). Speaker sounds are very low. system performance is low.  Display is good. Battery Backup is okk as of now since the use is less and gaming is not done. Could have included SSD Hard disk.
679,4,Good working
680,2,Not really satisfied with the product and the entire process till possession of it. Laptop takes forever to boot up. The response time is very slow. I don't know if you can run games smoothly takes forever to open Chrome.
681,1,heating issue lagging takes forever to load windows 50k wasted

684,4,Avarage
685,4,Very good
686,4,"Some softwares seems to be pixelated. Also, I could notice some lag during the file transfer. Multi tasking is not at most good for 8gb ram. It still has to be more efficient."
687,5,"used very well no issue reported as of now, little bit slow due to HDD."
688,5,Very good product..
689,5,Good
690,4,Battery is not God

697,4,Worth the money
698,5,"This laptop is literally amazing. But, a bit slow cause of hdd.. I'm certain it'll get much faster after adding an ssd."
699,4,The laptop takes very long to boot up...every app that I open takes very long to start..I don't know what the problem is...sometimes the laptop just freezes.....and while playing fifa 18 I noticed some frame drops which should not have been....because the GTX 1650 is a great processor....I tried to consult with the hp support ...but they said it's not the laptop defect....it's windows defect
700,1,This laptop is broken down within a month
701,2,"Laptop functions quite slow, starting from power ON. Even same with browsing. I observe buffer. Takes lot time to open application and switch between them.. Not upto the mark. Facing issues while using office tools. Not worth the investment of 55K."
702,5,"i like this laptop ,used outocad and heavy game smoothly"
703,1,I received a defective piece which is not getting on. Display is completely defective. I received this item as gift and hence took 20 days to unwrap. Now Flipkart says you only have the option to contact HP helpdesk. Really purchasing expensive items online for Gifts is risky because 7 day return policy gets overs till the time gift is unwrapped
704,5,"Writing review after using it for 5 months approx. It is best in market got at 49998 only. Used matlab and ansys software it has no lag. Played games like resident evil 6 , gta 5, mafia 3 . It is running game at 1080p at 40-60 fps. No issue of lag or heating is there. After playing for half an hour fan are starting to run but they are giving very cold air so no issue of beat. Temperature of graphic card maximum goes to 55 degree during games. Battery is .out 12 hrs on simple use and 6 hours o..."
705,4,Everything is good except an SSD would make a lot of difference in performance...and secondly the processor is little slower than intel i5 8th or 9th gen. But it is good compared to other gaming laptops in battery backup.
706,1,Too slow.. I used only 1weak.. The Performance is very slow..
707,5,Very good laptop must buy....it is very good for engineering students and fulfilling all requirements which we want for design purpose in this price..
708,1,Very bad to use on multiprocessing.
709,4,This laptop is very good But you have to upgrade the ram and ssd After upgrading it will become beast
710,5,"Excellent for the price but the ram we get is about 6gb, which is enough for day to day tasks but not for gaming... upgrading the ram is a must. HDD is a bit slow but if you want that snapiness in windows you can add an SSD. battery life is ok-ish of about 4 hrs"
711,3,Bro the speed is really very slow like its hangs for like 30sec after i close a game and booting time is 1min 10secs .... If anyone can fix this please let me know coz i had put all my 3 year savings on this laptop
712,3,Battery backup not so good. Games very slow
713,5,I happy with hp laptop and flipkart service. Thank you flipkart
714,4,it takes too much time to boot .it takes around 1;30 minutes
715,1,I got a faulty product.

717,1,Laptop is getting strucked when I use it for more than 3 hr
718,5,Very good laptop at its price range Best design Battery ok No doubt you can go for it
719,1,It heats so much.... unbearable...third class product of HP. Atleast low budget laptops have good performance but this laptop is so bad. It hangs like hell n then nothing happens. Very bad purchase. Nothing goes right with this laptop when compared to its specifications
720,1,I am using this laptop for about 4 months and it had ruined my experience it is worst thing i have purchased ever  it take about 1 minute to start or boot and still after that it get hanged up  i had run many softwares as an graphic designer and every time it screwed up at every last moment and  as for hp support they always tell to reset the pc on every call and every update never download properly  As for heating concern it heats alot if fans are not given it may explode Very cheap qual...
721,1,The delivery boy was a bit rude ...Design display and battery is good...but it seems a bit slow after updating the drivers it's ok ..booting time is 40-60 sec ..maybe due to less ram(6gb and 2gb Vega graphics) and HDD..after upgrading ram and adding ssd ...This will be a beast... everything else seems good..no heating problem..so if u think about this laptop this is ok and after upgrading with about 6-8k it will give best performance...like if you want any updates ....  After 10 days of u...
722,1,Laptop dead on arrival
723,1,Without ssd it's very much slow buy yah it's performance worth
724,2,The product advertises that it can be upgraded upto 1TB SSD but it cannot and HP confirmed that. The laptop is also very slow. I was not at all happy with it. It‚Äôs supposed to be a gaming laptop but if it‚Äôs so slow how can one play!!! This false advertisement on the sellers part is unforgivable.
725,3,Go for ssd varient It lacks even in bluestacks
726,2,After 6 month of User It‚Äôs really slow Takes lot of time to start
727,1,"I'm writing this after using it for 5 months.  Considering the configuration it has, the laptop is extremely slow. It takes nearly 3-5 mins just to switch on (even after minimizing almost all startup apps after consulting HP Customer Service. App loading is very slow. While playing game as well, game stutters (FIFA 19). So, performance wise, not at all good.  Looks is great. Keyboard backlight looks attractive, however you can't keep backlight on all the time as it consumes reasonable batter..."
728,5,There is only 5.9 gb usable ram in this laptop...
729,4,Battery backup is very low and performance is ok ok.! You can invest 5-10k more and go gor some better option.!
730,5,Very nice product..Perfect for Heavy gaming if you upgrade ram to 16gb..but its also nice to play with 8gb ram..only negative is booting time
731,1,Take so much time for booting... Too slow
732,5,Everything is great. Butiful Experience. But there is one problem HD varient is slow If you want faster experience Go for SSD varient
733,1,Machine is too slow. I think the performance issue is related to hdd and windows 10. Need to wait long time for machine to become responsive else it will show 100% disk usage. Users cant change the bios settings as its locked.
734,1,Worst laptop and worst service by Flipkart
735,4,I bought the laptop for more than 3 months now if you are a gamer go for an upgrade of ssd which will make your overall performance good The speakers are stunning compare to other laptops the b&o audio took it to the next level Display is epic with the streaming 4k video which is cool 8gb ram only 6 gb usable because of the consumption of integrated graphics card While gaming with hdd face lag issues for nfs payback bit after a bit its okay After a month i face a little bit of crashing issue...
736,3,Battry backup is very poor ... And please do not order this product ...without ssd it has very slow processor...
737,1,Worst product Very slow
738,1,Never buy a ryzen laptop Better go for i3 Intel it works better
739,1,This laptop is i am using but this is really working are slowly...i am not happy
740,1,Worst product..
741,1,I use this laptop 1 months its performance are soo bad lak problem software very slow working and so many problems
742,1,Physical memory installed is 8.0 GB but out of it only 5.88GB is usable. They have no explanation about this. They haven't mentioned this in their specifications. Think before you buy.
743,1,Too much from the date of purchase..
744,1,hard disk speed is too slow always shows 100% disk usage and games are lagging like hell.
745,5,The Laptop if you can get it around 48 with the SBI or HDFC cards offer then it's a really great deal. The HDDs a bit slow but that's nothing an SSD won't fix and an additional 8 gigs of Ram would make any other entry level gaming laptop run for its money. Bottomline with another 7k investment this will beat anything else below 60-65k
746,1,Laptop generates lot of heat while using it Lags a lot while playing Gta5 Laptop takes 3minutes to boot up It takes 20-30 seconds to respond for a click when there is no background app running. Performance is much less than an average laptop which is half the cost of this laptop. HP shouldn't call this a gaming laptop at all and the price is way too higher for the poor value delivered.
747,1,Hangs alot. Poor performance. Worst battery. Discharged within every 3 hour. Very poor experience. Even copying a single folder of 10 GB from one drive to another take about 1 hour time
748,5,Simply superb üòçüòä
749,2,Be ready to spend atleast 5k extra on this laptop for ssd .Out of the box this is a very poorly performing laptop the reason is the HDD. Definitely need a SSD. After getting ssd now I could run the games with discord open before I could not . Now I could alt+ tab within sec before it would crash. If possible upgrade ram to 8Gb 3300Mhz then this lap is a beast at the prize
750,1,"Very waste product i ever seened before.no customer care support.very very slow .. after 11 days the laptop showing very bad performance.the hp customer cares are not contacting me. After i submit a complaint.very very bad prduct.the flipkart , They do not givinge replacement also.don't by this product."
751,2,Laptop is a beast but very poor battery don't expect for a long time gaming should use while charging battery drains within 1hr for gaming and 2hrs of normal usage
752,1,Very very slow performance üòè. Processor very slow I'm not satisfied
753,5,Best in all way....
754,1,"Getting very slow after every 2 or 3 month. Don't purchase, if anyone going for this product"

766,5,I am using this laptop for 1 year now best value for money
767,1,Better to go for acer aspire 7 or ssd variant...I am Facing lot of issues. Worst perfomamce..
768,1,The worst laptop you can ever buy it has ram issues hp support also not able to fix my solution and you will only get 80 90 fps in valorant
769,5,So lets keep it simple fantastic product unless the vents at below it are open enough For gaming can handle everything And If u gaming try rising the laptop slightly to open up the vents which will make the performance noticeable way better multitasking will improve and the hdd kinda slow but when it also given enough breathing room will perform just well so prefer slightly rised like a cardboard roll shud do just fine Overall 10/10 its epic and the specs are just fine to stream and record...
770,5,"This is amazing I can use this laptop no lag,not any issues best laptop I think everyone buy this laptop"
771,5,"Great product , superb result , happy with the purchase ."
772,3,"This laptop has a Nvidia 1650 graphics card but by default internal onboard graphics is preferred by laptop for games. You need to change this setting in Nvidia control center to use Nvidia for graphics and games. Major downside of this laptop is it comes with 5400 rpm hard-disk, which causes it to perform very slow. For those who got this laptop with SSD, no problem for them, but for remaining they need to buy additional SSD to get decent day to day usage performance from this Laptop. Fina..."

798,4,Worth the money
799,3,It was really nice I like it
800,1,Do not buy this. Go for intel. It lags a lot.
801,4,There is one important thing about this laptop that is- If you add more ram upto 16gb and Ssd then this laptop is fantabulous. Warning!: Atleast 12gb of Ram is necessary to Run best of tour games.
802,3,It takes too much time to boot up.
803,3,Ok
804,2,Gaming performance was very good since it uses the graphics card. Rest of the normal day to day performance was very bad. The pc runs very slow and lagging even when you open a browser.
805,5,ITEM DELIVERED INTACT AND PERFORMING SATISFACTORILY TILL DATE. NO DEFECT FOUND AS I'VE BEEN USING IT FOR LAST 12 MONTHS.
806,5,Very good but take some time to booting
807,4,"Amazing laptop, but slower because of HDD, if my budget was more I would have bought same laptop with SSD."

824,1,Some of my internal parts are replaced by other quality less old parts .I just found out this today when I just opened it because of its very poor performance and I was shocked.if I found out earlier in the time of before replacement surely replaced it.and I would never buy a another product from Flipkart because then will never hesitate to fool me again
825,5,can we use pentab with this laptop ?
826,3,I work with android studio. But this lap can not run emulators. It a bit laggy than expected. I wont say its bad but could be better. If you are looking to do heavier tasks go for another higer ones.
827,4,Just upgrade with SSD then it's great
828,5,I am using this laptop from last 6 months and I must say it worths. If you are looking for gaming laptop then this laptop will the best option for you. You will neet to upgrade with SSD. You can use it for official work also
829,5,Good
830,5,I love it
831,4,ONE THING . The Warrenty.. Got a new one and instead of 12 months of warrenty it has only 8 months warranty left and . PC opened 4 months ago for just one day and even in your Hp site you cannot dispute the Warrenty issue because HP says it's not a Consumer product but a Business product.. No Idea what to do about this. And also system is slow and gets hanging simultaneously. Display is good. Sound is not good and loud as expected.
832,4,It takes too much time to start
833,5,Good
834,1,‚Ä¢The Processing speed is very slow ‚Ä¢Booting and Loading takes much time ‚Ä¢Overall looks are good   Is this because of the running of automatic windows updates !???

Tbh look is very cool but sharp edges are there.. packaging was very nice and safe also the delivery was on time... Thanks

866,3,"Well, the laptop could run GTA 5, with basic graphics. But, whenever I felt the game froze in the middle, I had to restart the laptop. The NFS Rivals car game ran very well, with minimal graphics. Crypto mining is not possible as the GPU only has 4 gb ram. Min you would need 6 gb for those kind of activities.  The boot time is a staggering 2 minutes 20 seconds and it's frustrating. The one I got was a replacement unit. Originally received one has defective display.  Waiting for the warranty..."

888,1,"Very poor laptop from HP. The design itself is faulty as the charging point location is bound to create problem due to its positioning on the laptop. Battery itself has been ok but it is difficult to get it charged. Display is ok but again due to design the screen panel vibrates even with the fan speed. With such impressive specifications the laptops takes too much of time to boot. This is for normal functions, i havent even used it for gaming purpose yet. Charger seems to be a cheap third gr..."

894,4,The laptop performance is not that good... because it requires to be upgraded.it is bang for the buck but without ram upgrade to 16gb and SSD you can't play any good AAA title game even at low settings...this issue is due to 2.1gb ram occupied by Vega 8 integrated graphics and paging issue due to HDD and low ram....go for it only if you can upgrade or go for another laptop...this is not a ready to play gaming laptop...

907,3,"If you like to buy this product go right ahead, this is a great budget gaming laptop the two downside of this laptop is out of the 8gb ram you are getting only 6gb usable the rest is used by the system so i will recommend you to upgrade the ram with atleast 4gb or 8gb ram stick and the second downside is that the 5400rpm hdd is very slow so i will also recommend a 512gb ssd upgrade for gaming"
908,3,The screen was not working . Chk before you take this product. Hope i get a replacement of a gud quality.
909,5,If you want a gaming laptop.You can definitely go with this laptop.But keep a thing in mind that it has a integrated graphic card which is AMD radeon vega 8 so it allocate approx 2GB of the RAM memory so you'll get only approx 5.9GB memory for RAM so heavy games like GTA V needs atleast 8GB of ram then it uses the virtual memory that is not much fast as RAM so you will feel some framedrops if you are a gamer so you have to upgrade the RAM.And also you can't deallocate the memory from the HP b...

Adobe suite works flawlessly. 3 d modelling software works without any issues. Heating could be a issue while performing 3d rendering, suggest using a cooling pad to keep temp. In control.  On stock hdd ..boot time is more..suggest to upgrade to ssd and ram upgrade from hp service centre ..in order keep warranty intact."

924,1,Speakers are not working !!
925,4,It's good device in this price range packed with a good graphic card sleek design and a pretty decent processor the only and biggest draw back lack of ssd though you can cop it with a additional sum of 5000 bucks by adding a ssd ( got with nvme m.2 ssd) and you will be left no complaint.

And with this lap we can play games in a 60p frame per second but it takes some more time to open because of the hdd in the lap. Battery backup is good as it can last over 3.5 hrs min and 5 hrs of maximum timing.and the backlit keyboard is the feature that i found very much useful and also looks great in night time. Overall its a performance g...

Performance wise it's ok, as I use it for editing purposes, takes time to render even JPEGs. But I think once upgraded to its full power and windows, softwares shifted to SSD, then it will be a real solid beast. As of now am loving it very much and it's a value for money buy. One thing that I found odd is the key..."

960,4,Honest Review! This laptop is good for normal usage and light gaming purposes though it is very slow without an external SSD .So I would really recommend you to get a SSD and if possible upgrade the ram to 16 gb for flawless gaming.Sound quality is decent and video quality is sharp.
961,5,This is a budget gaming beast

965,3,"The Laptop is good but since there is no SSD, the bootup time takes much more than the expected time (Approx 4-5 Mins). The company is also not providing the MS Office lifetime access (which we have to pay separately). Sometimes even the responding time is also slow. Sometimes the type c port is not working properly for transferring files and for charging. There is no global warranty for this product."

974,4,"I have been using this for over 4 month now. It has geniunly stood up for my needs Been doing some coding and cad drawing using solidworks  Works just fine with this graphic card.. Rendering speed is good but 1) u will need a ssd asap At this point takes around 3 minutes to start and lags for some seconds too. 2) this does not include office 3) has macafee antivirus for only 21 days  Other than that coders, designers, students. If you are on a budget go for this one. Best of luck"

993,5,Amazing product start very fast without sad there is a slot for sad that you can upgrade. Design is awesome most of this violet purple you will love it. Go fot it.
994,4,Laptop is okay . But some times it become unresponsive when I use premier pro. 2gb Ram is acquired by the CPU for iGPU. But it's value for money if you can pls upgrade ram and make partitions in HDD. It's perfect but some time it lag away.
995,4,The laptop was nice and all things are good and worth.but there is issues because of HDD lagging issues. But there is a slot for SSD also. While i set the SSD it was a good experience and no more lagging. So while you buy the laptop you should add ssd in it.
996,5,good
997,5,"This laptop beast needs to be evolved. For 50k price, design, finish, core, display and graphics are great. All it needs is a 512gb m2 nvme ssd with another 8 gigs ram. One of my best buys in flipkart so far."

Use medium settings for higher specifications games and keep graphic drivers updated all time for best performance. I only have one issue that is of battery life. It has very low battery life of around 3-4 hrs. All in all best laptop for gaming and heavy software

1089,5,Great laptop for price..but you have to upgrade ssd & ram.. after that it will become beast... battery not that great... charger heats up alot while playing games .. Overall great product...no ms office..
1090,4,SSD+RAM =Total Bease
1091,3,Fornsome reason the lap was lagging from day one... Had to put in an ssd to solve it and i experience zevere frame drop while playing rdr2 in lowest settings... Domt know y... If anyone knows lemme know
1092,5,"Bought this 4 months ago for module designing it performed nicely slower at the initial but now got updated and its lightning fast without ssd also speed is good, only upgrade needed is ram which is optional now.. its a value for money product playing heavy games and using designing software together it doesn't glitch, i was skeptical about it as first but now i feel it was a right decision. Happy to buy ?"
1093,4,BUILD quality is not so good. hp should think about this. otherwise inthis price this is very good spefication. good laptop. you can buy this.after buying if you add one ssd & 8gb ram then it's perfomance will go another level.

1096,4,Best product in the range
1097,5,All Rounder
1098,3,First of all The delivery was late You need to buy a ram stick and a ssd other vise you have to wait a long time to start or reboot the laptop
1099,2,The performance is not great... don't go after this product because of the popularity...The gaming performance is very average... couldn't play watch dogs 2...it's lagging way too much even in lowest graphic settings... disappointed
1100,4,build quality - best plastic speaker - trust me not the loudest but best speaker in this price segment and also beat in terms of 60k laptop trust me you will love it  performance - due to hdd it will lag or slow at time of booting thats hearts üíî  display - no words ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è  and at last there will be frame drop due in gta v due to low ram because the usable ram is only 3 gb out 8 2 gb is used due to amd procceser and out of 6 gb usable is only 3  so if you are going to buy this laptop in 2...
1101,5,Buy without thinking. Excellent product at this price.
1102,4,Everything is good but One thing disappoint that ms office is not pre-installed.
1103,5,"It contains amd radeon 2gb+Nvidia GeForce GTX 16504gb graphics cards.But usable ram is only 5.95gb Disappointing thing is only the matt black colour ut contains alot of fingerprints and dust.

1105,5,"A great laptop on this price range. After using it for 3 days im so happy that i choosed this laptop over acer aspire 7 and msi gf63 thin. Pros: -Great performance.

1106,2,"This is the worst product i ever used , performance wise it is very slow . If I compare its speed, it is the same as a mini notebook or the same as a normal laptop. If i talk about its speed it takes 30-40 sec to open an excel file. I am very disappointed with its performance . As a gaming laptop it has to respond on just a click.  I have not received any benefit with this product even Microsoft word, excel & power point are also paid software. I am suggesting never buy a laptop through onl..."
1107,1,"Most pathetic, horrible laptop. It lags a lot. A chrome book is better than this. It takes 10 seconds to open firefox browser. When it comes to games...it lags like an old computer. Don't believe that this laptop is for budget gaming by going through the specs. It's a waste of money."
1108,5,Amezing product

1124,1,Poor quality camera... slow performance... Not at all value for money.. Requested for replacement... Lets see..
1125,4,Actually I read a lot of reviews here and it said it's too slow... Believe me it's not that slow ...You will feel its slow only if you have used a ssd variant before .. Just go for it.. And update your bios and drivers and you are good to go.. I just took off a star for delivery it was a bit slow it took 14 days to deliver the product
1126,3,Okay okay not very good the thing is the likes are great and the battery is also good the only thing which is a problem is its speed its slow and yes I dont mean slowing or a bit slow it's very slow
1127,4,Good prodect

1130,2,Battery backup is low . Performance is poor.
1131,5,Throw in a nvme m.2 and you are good to go. Either purchase the modal with ssd or install one. Otherwise don't buy it.

1149,1,"Not a good laptop, built quality is low, very slow"
1150,5,Nice good laptop
1151,5,Hdd is littel slow but you upgrade ssd then this laptop is beast in performance
1152,5,Good laptop for casual work and gaming
1153,5,Once it will taking lot of time for booting but it's assume look and quality when we will upgrade ram and ssd it will become a beast laptop happy to buying beautiful laptop. When I received small bending in touch pad but it working so I didn't replaced for very small bend it works nice
1154,5,It's the beast go for it
1155,4,This product is great in the price range of 49K. I would suggest to upgrade ssd and ram after purchase as it will turn this into a more powerfull machine. The only shortfall I found was the fact that bios locks the advanced settings area which limits ram of this lap to 6 or 5.8 gb and wastes the potential of 2 gb in igpu which is not needed as it has a dedicated gpu as well
1156,1,I got a hang issue from the beginning. Now its 3 month's and it's still the same
1157,5,beast laptop at this price
1158,5,Definitely add a SSD to it... Otherwise the lap is too slow to boot up and run... Its a plus to add up to 1tb ssd upon the inbuilt HDD.
1159,3,This laptop is very good but other 0battery is very bad for me only one hour play game I am suggest a pc for gaming but this is good
1160,5,good

1165,5,u can use it for normal use gaming and much better battery and backlit keyboard is best
1166,4,Can anyone explain what is this small white light for?
1167,4,3 day used. I purchased this product only for normal purpose and Adobe Photoshop. This is good for me
1168,3,Battery is is week and speed is also slow recommend ssd drive
1169,5,Very good product value for money
1170,3,There is a slowness because of th hard disk which can be fixed by installing a SSD. There is 5.98/8gb is only usable as the processor is apu. But it's not a problem for gaming without streaming. Edit:Gaming is too horrible with the default ram we should upgrade it to get good performance
1171,5,I am totally impressed with this product Worth for Money Under 50k best gaming laptop
1172,5,Beat product in mid-range. Beast of mid-range. If your budget is 50000 i prefer you to buy this laptop. It's a beast.
1173,4,Overall pretty good gaming experience but poor battery
1174,5,Genuinely good product after 1 week of use. Using mainly for programming will start gaming and review later. So far good laptop. I love this gadget.
1175,1,Dnt buy very slow while using cad software

1177,4,It is good... Boot tym is slow... But it could be solved by increasing the ram....
1178,5,Good Product
1179,5,Looks premium but gets oil marks everywhere. Ssd is a must if you want fast loading speed. Upgrade ram also if you do multitasking of heavy apps. Ram frequency 1600mhz
1180,4,Very very good.... I am completely satified
1181,5,I bought this for mobile game development and coding and unteal engine and other apps work smoothly on this . Also gta v runs perfectly. No need to add ssd but yes ram can be upgraded to 16 gb to even more enhance the laptop but without it also it works fantastic.
1182,3,I can play free fire with lag
1183,5,Awesome product
1184,1,Waste of money
1185,4,"When I bought this loptop earlier I thought why it performs very slow like opening applications, loading, taking more time to boot up later, I realised and I added SSD to this after that it will performing like a beast and now it is booting in 15 seconds.

1198,4,Entry level laptop
1199,4,Nice one. Increase ram for better productivity. That's it. People say go for SSD. But it isn't compulsory. HDD works fine as well.
1200,4,Best in value for money...as it's HDD so performance is quite slow
1201,5,Good performance...
1202,5,It is best under prize range
1203,5,Excellent product delivered only with in 2 days
1204,5,"I would say this laptop is value for money, a great machine from HP. Since there is no SSD pre installed, I would say, it would be great if the user installs an SSD after purchasing this device. I have installed an SSD onto the machine and now most of the games I'm getting more FPS and more enjoyable."

1213,3,Dont expect too much
1214,3,While running editing softwares for coding or some other big softwares...it slows down coz of the 6gb ram(+2gb internal graphics)...ram upgrade and ssd upgrade can help sort this issue....otherwise 5 out 5 on value for money.
1215,4,Superb quality
1216,4,Gud product and value for money
1217,3,If thay have added even a 128Gb SSD means it's an amazing deal..
1218,1,"Without SSD and 8 GB memory the system is unusable.  Having put 256 GB SSD and 8 GB more memory, the system performance is very good.  Not sure why they have not made it default configuration."

1393,5,Good
1394,5,Product is good.. Satisfied
1395,2,5.58 gb ram only usable pls avoid to buy this laptop Its booting time is not fast it take too much time Design was awsome.but its has only design...
1396,4,Everything seems to be perfect except at this price range we deserve ssd and slightly better build quality . Overall nice experience.
1397,5,This laptop is very good but if u need gaming faster then you need to attach a ssd around 140GB or 240Gb.
1398,4,All good but processing low because HDD. So i recommend buy with SSD
1399,5,Super good
1400,4,Everything is good but it takes long time to boot.
1401,4,Battery is a average factor 3/5... But overall price and features 4/5.
1402,3,Battery not good...only works 3 hrs
1403,4,At this price its worth buying without a second thought.
1404,4,Good
1405,3,Battery in high performance is only 30 to 50 minute
1406,5,Best Product Truly
1407,4,"Good product for basic level gaming, designing, autocad, photo shop and it comes with good price"
1408,3,Don't buy ryzen take intel
1409,5,Just amazing
1410,5,The best
1411,4,"Best laptop for this price range, Best display. Performance is great, it has extra slot for ram and ssd. The only drawback is that hp locked the bios due to this the vega graphics reserves 2 gb ram so only 6 gb ram is usable because of this games like GTA V, Shadow of the tomb raider, RDR 2 stutters (playable but annoying). Upgrading the Ram to 16 gb fix this issues and makes this a bang for the buck."
1412,4,Nice
1413,3,Battery backup is very worst
1414,3,"Average one , battery drain is too fast, much lags we will face even while normal use also."
1415,5,"The laptop is great overall and the GTX1650ti can run most modern AAA games, display is awesome and performance is good... BUT A RAM AND SSD UPGRADE IS MUST... And battery life is somewhat short but that's expected from a gaming laptop.  Get at least a RAM upgrade (if u don't mind longer booting and loading times) and this beast is ready to go"
1416,5,In this price range You can get this as a best deal... the battery backup could be better... otherwise product is best üî•
1417,5,The heating is more and gaming are lagaing But good
1418,5,Received the product within 03 days of placing order. Performance is great considering the price point. AMD does a great job and is comparable to i5 9th gen. Overall recommended.
1419,4,If you are a gaming person than ram upgradation is must. Build quality is upto the mark in this price range .
1420,5,Very nice products
1421,1,"I had an issue as there was a stuck pixel on my laptop and even though it's a manufacturing defect, hp does not want to help me. I'm also under warranty."
1422,5,Only upgrade to ssd and it will be a rocket
1423,4,Great gaming laptop in this price range. You can easily play most modern games on High settings and get around 45-60 fps.  One thing that they don't tell you us that 2gb RAM is reserved for the integrated graphics so you only have around 5.9 gb RAM available which can cause issues with latest games. So I would suggest getting an extra 8gb RAM if you want to smoothly play all the latest titles.
1424,4,It is a great budget buy as it has capacity to upgrade Like extra ram slot (which you require soon as ryzen blocks 2 gb by default) and m0.2 slot for SSD so ample opportunity to upgrade value for money
1425,5,Excellent product
1426,2,Microsoft office home & Student not installed in this laptop.Buy seperately cost 8000 Rs.
1427,4,Great
1428,1,Vesy slow performance unexpected from HP
1429,5,Go for it if you want a good laptop for gaming and video editing
1430,3,Lagging not satisfied with the product
1431,3,This laptop hangs. Like seriously after this much of processors and RAMs. Should have gone for SSD one thats beast.
1432,1,It claims 8gb ram but only 6gb is usable. The processor gets very slow eventually.. Not good for gaming
1433,1,Third class laptop no refund
1434,5,Good machine in this prise segment I suggest only this device
1435,5,ALL ARE GOOD. - Only things what I am Missing... Is SSD - Awesome laptop with very good performance - Got this @46 in Diwali Sale..
1436,5,Great performance and looking too good
1437,5,"Best laptop in this price range . If you are playing games casually then this must be your choice. Initially the games will get lag but if u add 8 GB ram upgrade the laptop works smoothly any games at 16 GB ram. So ram upgrade is must. I play PUBG PC, GTA 5, Valorant , Warzone,Apex Legends,Fortnite,CS Go, Watchdogs 2,RDR 2etc.... You can play any high specs game only with a ram upgrade. Battery is the only problem with this lap but while u r playing games just plug in the charger and play you..."

1445,2,After 2months use... Trust me guys the system is too slow and my old pc with 2 gb ram was faster... Tried calling the customer support many times and no resolution the laptop is still slow. Normal things take time like even if I want to open browser or my computer it srsly takes atleast 45-50secs which is slow for a 8gb ram laptop and imagine playing games or using heavy softwares. Battery hardly holds for 2hrs drains like anything and even when I fully charge the laptop and it's turned off ...

1452,4,Very good product. Delivery was very fast
1453,1,Its a average laptop to buy at this price point. Everything is average except for the ram it uses. I don't know why but out of the 8gbram is only 5gb is useable. This seriously slows down the laptop. Can't change the settings through bios because it is locked by HP  Do check the physical condition of the laptop. The first one i got had a problem with the F6 key.it came out of the keyboard.
1454,1,Received defective product. Flipkart replaced it. After replacing again received defective product. Didn't expect this from flipkart or hp. Worst experience ever.
1455,3,Laptop isn't that great until it has an ssd in it because without ssd it's just frustrating to use this lap Otherwise for gaming it's a beast and for multitasking too Go for this one if u have a budget below 50k
1456,5,"On battery the display is good.. otherwise without battery the light is low. Gaming is smooth with 12Gb ram and 16Gb ram for COD warzone, GTA V, Assassin creed series including Odyssey, Apex Legends, Horizon zero dawn etc"
1457,1,Worst... product....super slow...don't waste money
1458,5,Very nice model with good performance
1459,4,"Such an awesome laptop ,beast in performance"
1460,2,"The laptop is very slow..Taking too much time to open any app. Also take approx 4-5 sec to refresh..my 14 yrs old pc having ram 2 gb , dual core processor is much faster than this laptop.. .Infact i didnt get refund option..Flipkart did fraud with me."
1461,4,Ok
1462,5,It's pretty decent laptop. The only problem is it doesn't support hardware virtualization. It means you won't be able to use virtual box or VMware. Just think before you purchase
1463,1,"On Flipkart page it was written 0% intrest EMI from Kotak Bank. But both cheated as Bank started charging intrest. And on complaining to both, no solution was done. They just tossed the ball in other party's area to resolve the problem. Atlast I made prepayment of that emi to save the intrest amount"
1464,5,Excellent
1465,5,Nice

1472,3,Buy asus better then this
1473,3,Upgrade to ssd. Boot up is pretty slow as well as opening softwares. But a RAM too if you want a lili but of additional performance
1474,4,Battery backup is not so good but all other features are just amazing üî•
1475,4,"If you upgrade it with an extra 8gb ram supported with SSD, then there shouldn't be any complaint about its performance. Yes, sometimes the mouse cursor gets stuck somewhere, but that is only for a second and not frequently. It handles most of the new generation or AAA games pretty much efficiently. Overall, I'm really satisfied. But you need to upgrade it with SSD and another 8gb of ram."
1476,3,"Gud laptop in this price range! Gave 3star becouse HD version is so slow, go for an SSD version or add an SSD to it."
1477,2,"Not very satisfying performance, I got a damaged products for the first time and the replacement process in one word ""Degaster"". Finally after more then 50 call I got the replacement after 18 days. So simply avoid the product."
1478,4,Not gud for this price better to go with ssd
1479,2,The laptop is very slow probably due to so many adm drivers. Look is very cool but very low grade performance.

Games not running smoothly sometimes game freezes for couple of seconds while playing. Sometimes even if i don't play a game it hangs."
1488,3,Overall decent laptop. Loud fans. Bootup time is slow for a new laptop. No heating issue so far. Above average for gaming and general use.

If you'll install an ssd , and upgrade the ram, it will increase the performance."
1499,4,This is best laptop at this budget ...but compare to pavillion ryzen 5 vs aspire 7 i think aspire 7 is best and given best perfomance level if the budget is same go for aspire 7 or if you need to buy this laptop You should insert ssd on it...

It takes approx 30-90- sec to start and all the apps open very slow. Moreover, only 5.88 GB ram can be used out of the 8GB as 2GB ram is reserved for igpu this makes the games to lag a bit and they cant be run in max settings.

Built up quality is excellent. Speaker is awesome (5 stars). Laptop heats very little during gamming. Finally, I am happy to purchased this laptop."
1537,5,They say it's Gaming Laptop but to actually play games on it with a decent FPS (60-70) you have upgrade ram as well as install SSD!
1538,5,"its a awesome laptop, only draw back is the battery, but that too is that bad, it does'nt heat up or anything, but if you play high graphical powered games like GTA 5, WATCHDOGS, etc, it last about only an hour in battery settings high performance. it does'nt lag or shuts down randomly. if you are looking for a reliable laptop with good graphics and high performance gaming. perfect laptop for you."

1558,3,The product is good you can play Valorant at 150-200 fps in medium settings and play many other games I haven't tried GTA 5 yet as it takes a hell lot of time to download The only reason I gave it a 3 star rating is because of the exchange reason. They told they will give me 11k discount but when they came they told a reason which isn't mentioned in the check list but still they told us to pay 7k more so I could only get discount for 4k Everything was good the laptop was fast it had good spec...
1559,3,"I bought this laptop about a month ago.The design looks super cool and gaming too was very good.I have played COD Ghost,GTA 5 etc. and the perfomance was good(there is some lag now and then).But there are some serious perfomance issues i must point out. --It takes a good amount of time to start the lap. --the desktop lags very badly and it really tests our patience. -- while browsing this lap makes me think that those who built it never thought of any other use than gaming.Its really that bad..."

1561,5,"Seems to working fine for now, and I've been using it for over a month. The display is just mesmerizing.  Even though you expect the gaming laptop to have good speed, you can't just pile up tasks on it and expect it to run smooth.  Also, a lot of people are complaining about the battery, which is absolutely ridiculous. The high grade cpu and GPU obviously take more energy than your regular potato pc. Also, if you run a heavy app, the laptop is bound to lose energy quickly.  Overall, a good pu..."
1562,3,"Colour accuracy is very poor ..so people planning to buy this for digital works ,kindly think before buying."
1563,4,"A really good laptop in this price range.  Design is simple and doesn't look very aggressive like other gaming laptops.The complete body is made of plastic but is well built considering the price.  There is lag for almost 5 min when turned on after that functions smoothly.CAD softwares like AutoCAD,3dsmax and photoshop works fine. But the lack of an ssd can be felt as it takes lot of time to load applications.ETS 2 runs at an fps of 45 to 55 in max graphics settings while plugged in.  The in..."
1564,4,Great laptop for coding and gaming I tried visual studio and valorant on it and it works perfectly fine. Battery backup is also satisfactory
1565,5,Nice Product
1566,5,Highly recommended one. Excellent performance. The system is so fast . And more importantly nice and handy to use.
1567,1,"I wouldn't recommend you this laptop. I started facing small problems like really slow performance and hang. Now, it's been only a few days and it won't even start. It's not going past the welcome screen. I tried everything but it's stuck at welcome. The laptop asked for an update and it all started from there. I installed just one game and played it less than 1 hr. I am really upset and angry"
1568,3,"It does say it's a gaming laptop but most of the high level games do not run smoothly, and it gets hanged frequently while gaming. Not the best laptop for gaming."
1569,2,Not bad
1570,4,"Overall Good and value for money. I brought this 49k. But if u are doing some heavy task like heavy coding then the ram is not sufficient for you, you need to upgrade it."

1578,2,"Bit slower,battery backup very bad i am using it..in every 20 mins it goes down by 10 percent.. Don't go for it"
1579,1,worst product...very slow... don't buy HDD version
1580,5,Very nice product with super performance. Meeting the specs and expectations. Good gaming laptop with strong performance
1581,5,Its a beast at this price. Go for it. I played GTA 5 and it ran smoothly but obviously not on ultra high graphics. It's good for everything mainly gaming. But you should upgrade your ram to 16gb for maximum performance.
1582,1,Worst battery. Not charging properly its not being a week.
1583,4,Battery is below average.... Without buying separate ssd don't consider this laptop..else its good one..‚úåÔ∏è
1584,4,This is best budget laptop for student and gamers Aslo good for official work. Pro. 1.Average battery is 4-5 hours. 2.Overall performance is best in this budget. 3.graphis is good üòé  Cons. 1.ms office is not provide these is bad move from hp.
1585,4,Issue noted while charging. Technician rectified it Over all performance is good
1586,4,Good so far
1587,5,nice
1588,4,"Build quality is not so good neither bad, single core tasks are relatively slow in consideration with Intel as this ones running on ryzen, but overall it's a good product worth the buy"
1589,5,It's a beast..
1590,5,Excellent Laptop for Gamer and 3D Software and run Smoothly. I got 49000 in big billion day
1591,4,Giving review after usage of nearly 20 days. The laptop is working smoothly with its good gaming performance... The battery performance is good...for normal usage it goes around 4.5hrs Internet surfing approx 3.5 hrs And if u want to do heavy gaming than u need to put it charger......the battery drains very fast...... And the display is also very good Sound is also very very good... I bought this is Bigbillion day @48750 So close your eyes and buy it Very good laptop in this range....
1592,5,It is massive but has a less battery
1593,4,As per performance it's really awesome. But HP support team just bogus. Firstly they try to avoid the problem and manipulate the issue. Secondly maximum support staaf has list technical knowledge. They even not know minimum specifications of your laptop. Just horrible.
1594,1,Slow processer neither good for gameing nor for graphics designing
1595,4,Nice laptop
1596,1,We are continue getting trouble in sound and after complaint still nit solved
1597,5,Amazing üòç
1598,5,"The most perfect laptop in this price segment. I was a bit confused when i heard everyone saying that its slow. But after buying it I can surely say that its the best , no slow working nothing, booting takes 17 sec and many high spec games can be run like PUBG,GTA 5 AND MANYMORE..!! IF U R WILLING TO GET A LAPTOP FOR 50K THEN JUST GO FOR IT..!!‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫"
1599,1,system hangs on normal usage. forget about games. just chrome with 6-7 tabs. ram was said 8 gb but ur task manager shows max as 5.9G. I think it is taken for some other processing. note over this 2.6G taken by windows with no apps open. so u will be left with meager 2 gb for all ur application. very bad decision going with rysen and windows 10. also this is not ssd but I was expecting little faster boot time. my old i3 lap with win 7 starts faster. bad decision choosing the product
1600,1,Display and Performance is awesome but battery sucks
1601,1,It's new product Still it's lagging much
1602,4,"It has battery issues, otherwise great performance!"
1603,5,If you are only taking for regular task like meetings and projects on ms office than go for it . It's the best  If you are taking for gaming then go with this   But u can't do everything on it..  It's not fast  Boot up in 35 seconds..
1604,5,its best i have issue with lotz of heating while gaming
1605,1,my concern is on battery backup.it last only for 3 hour on an average.....never buy ..it is tooo much hanging
1606,1,The hard disk of the laptop was damaged within 7 days..... Really upset with such kind of product... Flipcart customer support is also not responding to the issues..such kind of response was not expected by flipcart

1615,4,"It is quiet slow in running apps like IDE,Chrome"
1616,5,excellent for gaming. but there is bug which locks your pc within few minutes of playing game. simply go to hp site and update your bios. problem resolved 100%
1617,5,Amazing
1618,1,The Processer is not working properly Processer is slow
1619,5,It is the best product for this price...
1620,5,"Product is too good. I bought it in Dussehra sale in 45 k. Worth every penny. Its been two weeks and I did not find any problems in it. Boot time is 12-15 sec. Battery backup is 4 hrs max in mix use i.e browsing, movie playing and working on files. Plastic used is good and design is awesome."
1621,4,Good product
1622,5,looks better in hand for performance improvement update bios and other drivers
1623,4,This is very good laptop performance is great everything is smooth. But if you might feel a bit slow booting when you restart but if you install ssd then it's great and it will be beast ? So if you planning to buy then go ahead ??
1624,5,Its overall very good but when I'm playing pubg in Hd extreme its sometimes hangüò¢ Otherwise gaming experience is superb.
1625,5,"Best laptop for budget laptop gamers, battery life , display and performance is very smooth and games like gta 5 can be played easily"
1626,5,Best laptop under 50k
1627,3,"Value for money, It is upgradeable to 32GB of DDR4 RAM. However HP should have provided screws to fasten M.2 SSD Drive. Got it for 46k"
1628,5,Verry good performance
1629,5,Nice one and ultimate music effect With B and O technology But for faster experience use ssd
1630,4,Loved the laptop.Just update your windows and booting time will reduce to 25-30sec.Add SSD for better performance.Delivery was slow.Overall a beast .Add SSD and ram for more awesomeness
1631,5,I have used this laptop for 1 week and now I am writing this review. I liked the performance of this laptop very much. Though it comes with HDD of 1TB at 5400 Rpm its gives 55-60 FPS in GTA 5 on very high settings...
1632,4,SSD is compulsory for good performance without it performance is bit slow and after adding 8 gb ram extra your laptop is complete.  Everything is good. Display quantity at its high performance.
1633,5,good product
1634,5,just go for it
1635,5,Laptop is one of the best be it normal performance or gaming display is bright and clear but it has battery low which nedds charging while gaming

1642,5,"Awsome products . Very nice products i got this in 45,000 during big billion days"
1643,5,"One of the best laptop in this price segment . I am happy of this product amazing performance , display quality is very good ha sharp detail.. i have brought this laptop BIG BILLION DAYS in 47000Rs. You should buy it weight 1.8kg very light weight compare to other brand gaming laptop"
1644,3,If you are going to buy this laptop so go for ssd variant or buy this and upgrade ssd otherwise laptop is very slow and add 1 8gb ram stick for overall good performance
1645,4,Reviewing after using 15 days 1) built quality - 7/10 little cracking sound comes when you open the hinge 2) booting timing is 30-40sec 3)I have purchased for using creo and ansys and it's running smoothly without any lag 4) battery backup for normal usage is 3.5hrs-4hrs 5) ms office is not provided 6)camera quality is avg
1646,1,Could be better. For solid works it's lagging. I don't know if it can support GTA 5 with ultra graphics. Audio is very disappointing..
1647,5,Laptop performance better. But need office installation key

1656,5,"Got this for 49990, it's a beast at it's price only drawback is it's design as built quality is not upto mark so you've to be very sensitive using it and hinge is very fragile. Spend 6-7k more to make this laptop perform like a beast get an SSD (500gb preferably) and 8gb RAM which i got at 2249 and then just notice it's performance in pretty much impressed by it's performance."
1657,4,Working fine

Battery drain fast when u connect with wifi, play games ..  But for normal use it is upto 4-4:30 hrs  My suggestion is if u want for clg and little bit gaming then go for it"
1661,5,Good for students and daily usages. Can do gaming in free time and watch movies. Best for all things.
1662,1,Very slow. Horrible batter backup.
1663,2,Not perfect...for gaming and graphic design...booting time is so high..
1664,1,Battery gets drained pretty quick you charge it to 100% and play for 2 hrs and that's it. Well coming to display you will be able to see screen bleed towards edges the processor is good for the price paid and overall you can play almost heavy games better if you add SSD to improve overall performance just battery and display is only concern rest all is pretty good for the price.
1665,4,Overall good product

Battery is average."

When i bought this i didnt knoiw much about HDD and SSD, if i had known, i wouldn't have bought this. After buying this i added samsung 256gb ssd which costed me 6000 rupees. it would be best if u buy ssd version of this, 256 gb ssd is better than hdd any day. Go for the ssd version (strongly recommending)"
1699,3,Well the battery last upto 3-4 hrs on extreme usage and it has heating issues when it comes to high end usage. Overall this laptop is good for average usage. If you want to increase the speed you can later on add the ssd card however the feels good when it comes to quality.

1705,4,Am using this for last few weeks. Actually the product is really worth for money. Where the first fault I found with the system is regarding its speed. When it was running on HDD the system was too slow where we get mad on while working on it. But for this cost availing SSD is not possible. Thus later I enquired at a HP service center and added a SSD of 250 gb without loosing its warranty. Thus now it is having a good speed and a slight problem is of getting hang after sitting idel for a lon...

1719,5,I got this machine in the big billion day sale & I must day it's a worth the money. Everything is upto the mark but it would be better if they had provided finger print sensor.
1720,5,"It's good but for decent gaming you should add additional ram to it for improvement. You can compromise with extra booting and loading time due to hdd, but you won't compromise with lag issues during game so it's highly recommend to upgrade its ram before ssd."
1721,5,Nice product I just love it.
1722,5,Superb in these price range because of hdd the performance is little bit slow those who want the best performance buy a M.2nvme Ssd and place in slot and see the performance it should like a beast .Battery bcakup was superb minimum 4-5 hours of normal usage and for gaming 2-3 hours

The speaker sound is decent , one can watch any movie without additional speakers in a closed room. The display is amazing , probably the best thing about this laptop.

I had trouble running games like NFS Payback due to lack of RAM and fps drops playing GTA IV as well (i know about the bad port of this game tho). But then, I thought of upgrading the RAM a little before going for a SSD. After the RAM upgrade, I couldn't believe the improvement lol I had to Google why has my pic improved so much.

1790,5,"I was a bit skeptical about buying this laptop as my first laptop with my first earnings. I didn't want regretful purchase. Although there were many powerful windows laptops, beefed up with specs in this category, I wanted one which could last for quite sometime and have decent battery life.

1794,5,A decent purchase at very low rate thanks to flipkart's sale offer..good packing and faster delivery. I found it a bit hard to use in the beginning since I was a Windows user for the past 12 years..but once your familiar it's really fun to use apple ecosystem..I would recommend as this is a good buy..since all the other newer versions of apple have USB type c ports which is not widely used which will result in buying an adaptor.
1795,5,"this is an awesome laptop it's good for programmers actually because programmers don't need much of video memory because there is not a lot of graphic intensive task that they do it's just about a good multi core processor. also when you have such a good build quality in a laptop you kind of are more focused into your work because you feel good when your working. :) and also there is a lot of online resources you can look come to for its review... thanks for making such good product, apple."

I will suggest you to actually buy a back cover with the mac as well as it will help you to protect your mac much better. With each update the functionality becomes better. i will divide this mac in between pros and cons. PROS: 1) Battery life is amazing 9-10hours to the max even if you use it continuously. 2) Can edit videos...
1799,5,excellent performance as expected.Camera quality is very good compare to others.Battery life is just a nightmare for other laptops.This mac is best for those users whose idea empowers towards multitasking.Charging point is magnetic and protected from a cover.Long charging wire and a classic design.Overall a very good choice for multitaskers.Finally great delivery by flipkart everything is okay inside the box and packaging is just terrific
1800,5,I am very happy with the product and the Flipkart services...guys don't go for other laptops in this budget....it's very smooth portable and good graphics too.....it's very good laptop for average users acc to me more than that...brand name also matters....the people who says dsplay is terrible I want to say to those guys that display is not bad ...it's very good ...the only drawback is viewing angle other wise 10 out 10 for dis laptop.
1801,5,this message is only for those who wants to learn or develop mobile apps. I bought this Macbook in November 2019. and the very first I installed android atudio. yes I'm an android developer. I tried running android studio and this beauty handles it very smoothly. I didn't faced any lag or hang. so I fired up android emulator too just to know if it can handle or not.

1808,5,I previously had one with 4 GB ram now I have the same config with 8gb. It works like a charm. Bit lag for Android studio and xcode. But that is ok since they are heavy softwares. Running simulators was pain in my 4 GB Mac but this one is pretty fast. If you are looking something for 4-5 years with medium to heavy use (I use my Macbook for 8-9 hours per day every day) and don't want to spend anything on maintenance Go buy it.

1863,5,Amazing product. Worth buying. With this price you will get high end specs with windows os but the stability of Mac os is 1000 tines way better than windows. Integration of external peripherals are ultimate. Watch videos if you are first time user.

Nicely packed and delivered by special delivery process by Flipkart.Purchased on 3 Sept and got delivered on 4 sept, Great delivery process by Flipkart."
1865,5,"very good product (light weight, high battery back up, reliable mac os, fast speed due to SSD and 8GB RAM, and doesn't heat up when used for long, and going by history of the product it should sustain all these good points even after years, unlike other laptops that deteriorate after few months or couple of years) and then unbeatable price as I bought it at final price of 48.5k"

1868,5,Definitely one of the better laptops I have purchased. I have been using windows since the beginning and by beginning I mean windows 98 version. But am amazed by the ease of use of Mac os X. Contrary to the popular belief it's easy to use and surely very stable. The macbook air is very sleek and sturdy. It's been made to last. An enjoying working on it and will recommend it my friends.
1869,5,"Got it for 50.5K. Delivered in 4 days. Last BBD it was an ipad and this time it is a macbook air. Flipkart deserves all the commendation. About the product, silence is the best way to review this product. You have to see it and feel it to believe it. If it is your first apple product, you will just caress it for some days. If you have been a budget laptop user like me, the screen is infact an upgrade. There was hardly any better quality screen available in laptops if you have a 2-3 year old w..."
1870,5,"Firstly Delivery was superfast. Product was properly packed And sealed. Its an apple product, you buy it because u are used to premium and hassle free interface. I previously had a macbook pro 2012 model was quite satisfied with it. But it had hdd drive, so the processing got little slow over time and it couldn‚Äôt keep up with the regular software updates and it started lagging. So i decided to with the air, because the price point was good and the new generation air are really nice but are a ..."
1871,5,I purchased this laptop on march 14th 2020 and I have been coding in this since then only and it is awesome laptop and it doeanot lags as the windows laptops and it is runming smoothly even after so much of huge code and also i am using photoshop and it is working fine.Design is awesome and I like the keyboard and the glass touchpad of apple and it is simply marvellous.
1872,5,"very elegant. very satisfied. its the best amongst all. super fast operations, bright hd display, awesome sound quality and lightning fast processing. loved it."
1873,4,"A very good mac, low end but works well for lighter tasks. I myself code a bit, watch movies, browse, and edit photos with a breeze. You could push it to its extremes by doing video editing too. Overall most satisfying. A very good lappy at the budget. I am a CSE student so I did a bit of research before buying a lappy and decided on this one. If you have more budget then you can go for the new mac(2018 the one with Retina display and smaller bezels) which is totally awesome"
1874,5,Mac OS is smooth and easy to use.... absolutely best buy for 2019 too....go for it with out a second thought.... don't get into too much research on screen pixel etc etc....for a normal user it's THE BEST laptop....not for gamers for sure....
1875,5,Beautiful Machine with great speed and nice battery back up ! Absolutely no hang ..nothing .Finally it's apple !! One drawback what I would like to mention is storage ..it would have been 256Gb . Rest is absolutely fine . Recommend to buy it !
1876,5,"Due to 1.8 GHz processor speed little slow other wise excelent product. really apple is a best brand, I purchased it Rs. 52K in big billian sale 2018. it's good looking, light weight,with good battary backup."
1877,5,"Ultimate Product and Complete Peace of Mind !!  I bought Mac Book Air 6 months ago during great India shopping day, stunning slim look and lowest weight. Best part is longest battery back up of 8-9 hrs."
1878,4,"One word Worthy MacBook boot time and apps launches pretty quickly because of SSD. Processor is quite fast and keyboard haptic feedback is great, backlit light bleed is very less. Battery performance top notch. One thing that this laptop lack is screen quality and resolution.. But you always have port to connect it in BIG screen."
1879,5,"Got it for 42k after exchange offer during the diwali sale. Got an August 2017 manufactured model, checked the serial number in Apple site and sure enough it had 1 year warranty. Packing was good and laptop was protected well.  It came with Mac os Sierra out of the box and there's a free upgrade to the latest os High Sierra. Performance is silky smooth but there's a steep learning curve if you're coming from windows. Although it's thin theres a reassuring weight to the machine. Better to get ..."
1880,5,One of the finest product I have ever used in my life. Apple had really done very good job by manufacturing such a product within reach of a middle family income. Commendable job.
1881,5,"Good and fast ,only limitation is 128 gb storage,upgraded from Catalina to BIG SUR ,many good features like my iPhone and iPad mini get connected so that I can pickup phone from laptop MacBook Air itself and no need to enter passwords etc provided u have same Apple ID ,compatible with Microsoft PowerPoint which I purchased separately"

For video editing for many layers and clips not suitable (suitable for inroom simple videos)"
1883,4,I could say this is the one of the best investment I have done.  The macbook air works perfectly for all my home and office work. The i5 processor is simultaneously able to handle the : -  1. Four Google Chrome Tabs 2. Three excel sheets 3. Two Word documents. 4. Microsoft Teams 5. Netflix 6. Youtube  I have not been able to find any performance issues so far. The applications switch smoothly between each other. The video call on Teams works perfectly without any glitches. The sound quality...
1884,5,"It is my first time when i was working on Macintosh and i am really impressed. It's been 7 months i have been using it, it never hanged till date and performance is great as compare to windows . For windows user who are facing issues with chrome, they will definitely go in love with this laptop. Battery backup is also good, it gives around 8-9 hrs of backup, if you are continuously working on it. Overall it's a good package, just go for it ."
1885,5,"I was little bit hesitant while buying it but since my wife loves Apple a lot, so it was the best gift option for me on her birthday. she was awfully struck with surprise while unboxing the pack.I have happily migrated from Windows to Mac now, its robust, stylish and exorbitant speed. perfect purchase. Thank you Flipkart and Seller"

1888,5,"After using Windows for more than a decade, I started using iPad. Impressed by the user friendliness of iPad I bought macbook air.  Pros: Very light, Long battery life (about one day of use), User friendly, very stable system (does not hang or crash), very good sound and picture quality, good metallic built, the experience of the mac ecosystem (iPad+macbook+iPod) is simply mind blowing (specially the air drop feature).

The Build quality is premium which we expect from Apple. 2. The person who wants to install IDE's for development purpose, these IDE's run extremely well and this laptop is also good for video editing purpose. 3.

1892,4,"Good laptop. For people who have normal use like for office. This is perfect. However, battery could have improved more. Charger cable get torn after few months, would recommend people to buy spiral band to avoid any wear and tear in cable."
1893,5,Got it in 47000 in Big Billion Sale 2018. Being a Windows user I must say MacBook is amazing. Initially it might feel a little odd in getting comfortable with the UI but once you are comfortable nothing stops you. A Linux user can easily familiarize himself with the OS. Boot Time and Battery backup is the best part. Storage size is a bit of a concern.
1894,5,"no matter what, Macbook is always way ahead of its competitors in case of performance. Although screen is not a retina display but far far better then other windows laptops. Good for daily light usage. Fast to boot and easy to use. You can also do light weight development as well. Works absolutely fine with IntelliJ."
1895,5,"Amazing product. I got it for my development and believe me it works so well with Android studio, jet brains ide. Till now no performance issues."
1896,4,"First, Flipkart is just too good at delivery! Product is perfect. Bought it in a hurry in the festive sale, as Apple raised the price of even the old model of Air by 17k. Overall. The product is good, handles office level multitasking pretty well. Though I had two instances of a slight lag for 3 seconds... (I had 25 application windows open at that Time). Typing is a breeze, adjust the keyboard setting ls to your speed, and it's great. The fluid design of the OS is known to all. Battery stan..."
1897,2,"Display sucks, battery life is great, portable enough so don't think of weight, battery life good enough you don't have to carry n charger everytime"
1898,5,"The product is insane. Superb speed and finesse both in terms of looks and in terms of performance. For people who fear they worked kn windows their entire life and now mac might be difficult, go buy it man.. nothing like that..you can learn it in a day..its amazing.. worth buying at this amazing price.."
1899,5,"So much Happy.. The Macbook Air is good and premium.The most youtube review says its display and viewing angles are bad but its not true.its having decent display look good,if you are moving from Windows to Mac using 30-40k windows laptop then you cant have any single complain.Besides the storage you can use an external Hard Drive for storing moving and extra stuff for normal storing purpose its great with required software in it. I so happy to get this device."
1900,5,"It's an Apple product so rest assured your not going to be disappointed even the slightest, great battery life, nice display, smooth Mac OS, can do casual gaming, top notch creativity machine. Fast delivery by Flipkart and great customer support. Money spent well"
1901,5,"It was very well packaged and delivered on time. Works like a dream, boots in seconds, even faster than some phones! Very smooth and is really good for web browsing, watching movies, light video and photo editing- that means you can edit vlogs easily in HD quality. Happy with the battery backup lasts close to 5-6 Hrs depending on the usage. Really happy that I didn‚Äôt buy windows at the same price!  Go for it, you won‚Äôt regret this super light robust laptop!"
1902,5,"Product is good. Very thin, light weight and portable. Although storage is very less only 98gb available from 120gb. Only 2 usb port. Charging adaptor is very handy easy to cary.  Editing the review after updating to big sur, it really lagging now. A windows laptop with ssd is much better than MacBook, because in future updates there are not going to slow down there machines intentionally. So that user buy the new one. Not value for money."
1903,5,"My Review after one month of usage. I would like to say Awesome product, Awesome Service, Awesome Delivery. Thank you Flipkart, Apple and Ekart Logistics as well."
1904,5,"It's awesome. I was waiting to buy this from long time. Finally I bought it at very good price 43k, thanks Flipkart sale.  For 43k I got MacBook air 2017. MacOS will blow ur mind. It's worth every penny your are paying. Everyone know the pros, the only con is screen. But trust me guys display is still awesome. It gives immense pleasure to work on Mac. It's must buy unless you are a gamer."

Pros Nearly no virus problem Starts very fast Looks so premium and out of the league. Light weight... Conclusion is hardware n build quality is best no point of comparison.  Cons for Windows user Mac OS. Not so user friendly. When u stuck on something u have to do it using script on command prompt linux based.  No HDD only SSD of 128gb No CD Rom N...

Bought it on big billion day offer.Its my first Apple product.Its easier than Windows as per me.It has a very classy look and sturdy built quality.Its very light compared to other laptops.The display is bit low,but we have to sacrifice atleast one to this stunning device.Finally I loved this superb product from Apple and lots of thanks to Flipkart for its good packaging service.Obviously I must rate this product 5‚≠ê."

1910,5,"I have been using macbook pro since 2 year. Now on flipkart exchanged with this macbook air at first glance it's pretty good looking device, thin, very light, attractive. Performance is good. Best part is TouchPad, smooth operating system which makes it different. People will say I'm using macbook so I'm telling all good about it but i sah try and see ur self. It's very nice to have a basic light weight and pretty good laptop."
1911,5,it's just a nice product
1912,5,This is my 2nd Macbook air. The best part about this laptop is you can also use windows operating system with this.
1913,5,When open the flap and start it you get the feel of this big package come in small size and elegant design . Finest creation of apple is helping out people to give an unprecedented experience of finesse quality speed performance and user friendly interface alongwith beautiful ergonomic design . Hats off

1918,1,quality is not good. keypad is not as apple is known for. as i think you will find better option in this price. I will not recommend for this product. total wastage of money. only those who have extra money they buy and give good review but if you really care for money never go for this product. Performance is not good after using a week. sound quality is average color is average most bad thing is its keypad. as i am using mackbook pro there is a lot difference in keypad. just buy if you ...
1919,5,I have been an apple fan for the last 20 years and continue to be one.  The MAC Air has been a long cherished need for my work and it fits in well. The form factor and functionality is enviable.  With the numerous apps that are available. It is indispensable as a working tool.
1920,5,"I had planned to buy this during the Big Billion Day Sale. With special discount on cards etc. i got a great deal. Now if one can compare it with any other windows laptops from good brands, this is cheaper or almost equivalent. But user experience from this product is butter smooth. Have been using since Oct '2018. No complaint. I have switched, in fact, from windows to Mac OS and found why people prefer Mac. And, thanks to Flipkart for making the product affordable."
1921,5,without a doubt I trust Flipkart. such a wonderful product received in perfect packing. @ just 49990 on big billion day. No one can beat this price. In Apple store it was available for 69500. Thank you Flipkart.

But we are not buying this expensive product for standby mode. Processor is fast and very responsive. That's the best part. Really good for kids to prepare ...
1932,5,"Earlier I was a windows user and used a Dell Inspiron for almost 8 years. As I passed out of college, now my requirement from my laptop changed. I wanted a laptop which is rigid, descent looking, compact in size and most important the battery backup. MacBook Air proved itself in every aspect I wanted. I am really happy with the product and I will recommend this product for all the professionals. I got this laptop for 52k with my old laptop exchanged."
1933,5,"I am a B.Tech CS student. I am using it. It's just awesome. it's so light weight that you can carry it anywhere. the battery is so oooo good. Also it opens matlab and Pucharm in just 7 sec and 5 sec respectively, which is mind blowing . The storage which you get it out of the box is 98 gb, which is not actually sufficient but you can manage easily if you are a professional user., and doesn't like useless things in your pc. Believe me You will love it."

I spend an average 6 hours a day using it for college and the battery still has a fair charge left. The screen looks great. Apple does a great job of integrating their products.

Nevertheless good job with the delivery flipkart. Appreciate"

1982,5,"Pros-: Super smooth. Awesome performance and much better experience than any high end windows PC. I am running cloudera Hadoop without any issues. Battery lasts for at least 10-12 hours. Web cam is average.  Cons-:  Only down side is display which is ideal for web surfing or coding but difference arises when you watch movies or videos.  Highly recommend for working professionals, coders, internet surfing etc. But not for gamers or watching movies."
1983,5,"Purchased it a month ago. So far going extremely well. Performance is mind blowing. Touch, screen quality and other aspects are good as per the apple standards. Overall worth product to buy!! - - - - Its been 2 years now and laptop is still working pretty smooth"

1985,5,"Honest review. Well, the name is enough ofcourse. Works pretty fine as long as you work normally. Laga at times opening large files. For the first 6months the battery backup was like 10-11hours but now its like 5-6 hours max. Heats up like a burner if you work while charging. Got this for 44500 , yeah okay its so so."
1986,5,"No doubt, an excellent laptop. if your preference is portability and long battery life, I think this is the best you can ever find. I am comfortably getting more than 12 hours continuous-usage battery back up. Also the charging is very fast. It hardly takes 1.5 hours for full charging from less than 10% to 100%. I need not specifically say anything else, since Apple is always known for making elegant products."

1998,4,"I would be just unbiased and honest here. This is an Apple product, so definitely it's accessories and Softwares which you'd buy are also gonna be a bit on the higher side of the scale. With 13.3 Inch of size, LCD screen (which is far better than those yesteryear LCDs), this is a hefty pricing product.

Purchased it on big billonday sale for a decent price.

Coming from the 2011 MacBook unibody(lasted me 7 years and still working) this is a very welcome upgrade. The specs are more than sufficient for my day to day work and business travels.
2101,5,I purchased it on last big billion day. After all the offers I just had to pay only 44.5k for this device. For me it is very good value for money deal. My main purpose is office work and just browsing and all. The device actually comes with and outdated chipset. But because of the os integration the device is blazing fast compared to my friends windows laptops with more advanced chipset. I know the main customers of this device must be buying their first mac os device. For those persons like ...

2111,5,The Macbook Air is an amazing product. It's a piece of art. Since last 20 years I have been using Windows PC so I was bit nervous if I will be able to adept to Mac.

2150,1,Not worth it to buy such a overly priced and overy hyped device. Its repairing costs more than the actual CP. This is horrible. Had to shed another 45000 for repairing its logic board.

I contacted flipkart customer care and got immediate response that as i am still under warrenty so I shall get free service from icare. I contacted icare and you cant believe they have replaced the charger COMPLETELY FREE OF COST!! so it is myth that online product doesnot comes with warranty."
2178,5,After 2 months : I can definitely assure you that you'll not be returning to the windows again after using mac... Everything is so simple and very well managed... Strongest point is it's battery... Sometimes I've got 14-15 hours of battery backup... In 60 days of usage I've just charged it 22 times (Voila!

My experience on very first day few keys are not working and I reached out to the Flipkart and they gave me response stating to visit and nearest mac service center. There is no replacement for the product and the solution for this fix is they need to replace whole keyboard. I am not happy because at the end I will be getting the repaired product and not the new one. ...

2267,5,If you want performance only go for it... Good for programmers
2268,4,"I have no words to describe about it, mind blowing"
2269,5,"Perhaps my biggest purchase online, thank u Flipkart for the offer on the product, speed is lighting fast and needless to talk much about apple which is world acclaimed. Happy to have bought the product and serves my purpose of drafting on the go"
2270,5,"While purchasing, I was a bit sceptical because of the specs of the laptop. But believe me, this laptop runs fast. Just keep in mind donot open too many Tabs of google chrome. The laptop had increased my productivity since it forces me to do one task at a time. Display is not that good. It will keep reminding you how old this model is. Other than that, this model is good for development work."
2271,4,so good
2272,5,It is the best laptop at the price 54990/-
2273,5,Best in style Best IN brand Best IN performance Best in class

2304,1,When I start after shutdown then mouse doesn't work and while updating OS also it failed after 99 % every time. Processing speed is too slow. They mentioned it has i5 processor but it doesn't work like that. Webcam quality is too bad.

2314,1,"--- UPDATE AFTER 10 DAYS: --- The backlit is flickering on 10th day. Flipkart says they won't replace the item, Apple says they'll be charging for it and I'm absolutely stuck between the two. It seems that I've lost my 60k spent on the product. DO NOT BUY FROM FLIPKART guys, buy from some place where they take responsibility for it.  --- OLD REVIEW: ---  Incredibly happy with my Macboook. A bit slow but difference is negligible, can't believe its so fast even with a 5th gen i5. Highly recomme..."
2315,1,"I purchased this on oct 2018. From that time I got 3 times issue. Now it is out of warranty and costing of repairing is 49,000/-. I am not happy with the product. Really very disappointed."
2316,1,product is gud but flipkart is a big big big lier... taking orders by showing great schemes like exchange but simply refusing to accept the exchanged products even for normal wear and tear of the product... a big fat fraud ecommerce... a big Noooooo to flipkart in future
2317,1,"Came in good packaging , was happy with the delivery and checked the serial number, and found original. Then after 3 days , not even used and the keys are loose and started falling off ! Frustrating ! Paid a huge amount and the build quality is pathetic ! It‚Äôs in service Center !!!"

As it's new, for it's long lasting review we have to wait for a year. Only one issue is it's less memory i.e 128 hard disk. It's ssd that's good. If you have a portable hardrive then it's ok."
2428,5,"i think that this is one of the best product Apple has made. Thanks to Steve Jobs.  Display is good. There are many people who complain that it is not good compared to newer models but it gets all the things done without any hassle. For the rest, everything is best."

2455,5,Awesome
2456,4,Product was genuine but 1 star reduced for slow delivery. I expected 2 day delivery but Flipkart took 4 days to deliver it.
2457,5,Apple is Apple. No One one can beat it  Pros: Best battery life Negligible boot time Powerfull machine Sleek and premimum design  Cons: Less storage but that can be overcome by having external Hard disk. Not for hardcore gaming  P.S: Purchased at Rs:45k  So if your budget is less than 50k go for it!

The delivery was delayed due to big billion day sales. It was delivered in good condition. Although one cons is it gives shocks when connected to charger. The shock is not noticeable so it's not a dealbreaker. Other than charging time, it doesn't gives a shock."

2515,5,I had lot of doubts before buying it.. but I am fully satisfied with it...works like a dream...very sleek...fast and stylish go for it you won't regret
2516,5,The Laptop is too good. If you want middle range macbook you can go for it. The package from filpkart is also upto the mark. Battery backup is solid. You have to purchased Office 360 for microsoft word and excel. Also you can update new software update. Just go for it you'll not regret..    Only thing is Rom 128GB but if you have external hard disk then its not that much problem. I'm using this macbook with 1TB HDD
2517,5,"Excellent product!! Got it for 41k including discounts, exchange, cashback...price made it sweeter!! Performance wise, i just felt resolution should have been more. Rest all good."
2518,5,Undoubtedly the best laptop with the budget of under 50K go for it! It is really great!
2519,5,"Got it for 43k from sale. And It has all , what you expect from a macbook."
2520,4,"Too soon to write a review about the product. It's a plain old MacBook Air. Plenty reviews available. So just writing about flipkart experience. Got a great deal during their festive sale, So that's nice. Delivery was very slow. Five days. Amazon delivers within 48 hours. Get some protective gear in time so you don't have to be extra careful handling it Update 1: A minor problem made me see the service center who the next day told me that they will have to replace the logic board because of w..."

2526,5,Very good laptop specially battery life.Purchased for tractor pro dj software. Delivery was well before time by Flipkart
2527,5,Good packaging After 5 day of use I will say that it's a little beast that beats windows based machine in every aspect. It's rightly said. First impression is the last impression. I got it for 45k in big billion day sale. It's worth. Don't hesitate just go for it.
2528,5,It's divert before .. packing was quite good .. Manufacturing 2017 Aug i was worry about that but it's recent model ..
2529,5,Got a awesome deal with exchange....
2530,5,Amazing product - apple products dont need words.

2532,5,Very good product ...great changeover for Me from Windows to Mac... way to go with Mac...
2533,5,Impressive!!!
2534,1,Damage product send so I suggest do not buy.
2535,5,Who else got it for 38K :D
2536,1,"Within two months it's stopped, I try to on but it not working"
2537,5,"Too confused to write any review. The product do not have any issues. But there is a but that I am unable to explain myself. So decision is all yours if you want go for it, if you do not want don't go for it."
2538,1,"While doing new update screen gone blank. Took it to service centre and they said mother board is gone and it will cost 36K from apple care support. This is nonsense and warranty period is just for 1 year after all you are spending so much amount and I got this problem exactly in 14 month from the day of purchase I missed by 2 months, my bad luck. Now my Mac book air is of no use after spending 70K with in just 1 year. Apple should increase the warranty period for manufacturing defects to 2 y..."
2539,5,This is one of the best MacBook from Apple. Even it is performing much better than the latest version of MacBook Air.
2540,2,If you want to buy it for that Apple logo and amazing build quality it will be a great buy... the problem is actually in mac os... If you switching from windows to mac( in this case you most probably are) you are actually downgrading in terms of os.. Mac is no where close to windows... You will feel cramped you won't find lots of handy options... Dragging is such a mess... And lot of such problems... That even you get familiar with the os you are going to miss tha windows os.
2541,5,This machine is great...for everyone except gamer....you see the specs are not so good as per price but the performance is better then i7 16 gb ram Windows laptop
2542,5,product.... is good.... i bought this mac at 45k recently....i dont know the real price exactly may be 60k or 70k....so guys out there wait for proper time and bye it.... If ur confuse buying mac 17 or other laptop -gamer these mac isnt for u -storage is low.... bt it dsnt matter me much coz i use for only for study purpose jst by saving pic n documents or any study matetial....i use it for watching movie.... later i delete that movie....these is how i save my storage *if u want to known more...
2543,5,nice product.fast deliver....love it
2544,5,"Laptop is super good, there is no need for a r view. But one main thing is seller's packing. It was packed carelessly with some Buble wrap pieces here and there. Apple's boxing for the MacBook was in bad shape when delivered. A simple footwear deserves better packing"
2545,1,Ok ok don‚Äôt worth it
2546,5,If you want apple you can buy this.  If you want laptop which will be useful for coding video editing and other stuff choose other brands   Apple is selling 10 rupees product for 1000 price with apple logo.
2547,1,"Very,very disappointing. Was expecting top-notch performance but found quite a lot of issues making it a deplorable experience for me. I moved from Windows for a better experience but clearly, it was a mistake."
2548,5,"Itz have been 90 days after buying this. Such a awesome product.. No drawbacks.. High performance,No lagging,No battery issues,10 hour battery backup,no charger problem.. üîπOnly problem is charger will heat much more we can prepare Tea or Omelet with this heat üòÅ. Just with one word about this Mac is """" Beast""""."
2549,4,"go for it in 2020 or 2021...Why not...??? It is batter than windows i7 and most of i5 super fast, world class designe, super display, long battery Once you use, you love mac OS I wiil get it only 45k in BBD 10/10/2018"
2550,1,Wrong please don't place order from this side or application it's worthless.. I purchased mackbook i5 but I saw a lot scratches in display after opening... So please don't purchase any apple product from this application (Flipkart)
2551,5,nice prodect
2552,1,the battery is draining very fast even with just internet surfing
2553,1,It is not so good as I thought before buying. Speed is almost same. Only you boast of brand name. It not so user friendly. Ms office is not there.
2554,1,Good product but price varies
2555,1,I bought a macbook air 2017 and it gives reapeated shocks while switching it on... It has some serious heating issues.. And guess what.. IT GOT STUCK AND DOESNT MOVE. AND THE ARROW KEYS FOESNT WORK ANYMORE!!!
2556,2,"don't buy this Laptop, the Mac Book Air very bad quality parts, this should be repair after 10 month or 15 months, the repair cast near 43000/- , if you ready pay next 43K , you will buy , or should be buy extend warrant , if not don't buy this Mac book. I am not understand the Big Apple product is very bad."
2557,3,Great
2558,2,Pathetic product delivered by flipkart. Charger stopped working after 7 months and even the mousepad. System shuts down abnormally. No response taken by flipkart so far after sending multiple emails. Waste of money and mentally harassing.
2559,4,Amazing quality
2560,5,The product is great. I will highly recommend this to everyone who is interested.Go for it guys.It is worth every penny üòä
2561,5,Very nice products.
2562,5,Good but price high
2563,1,"I have purchase this product before 1 year 4 months ago, but now it is dead. When i go at apple repair center then they asked me around 42000Rs for fix the issue in my Macbook air, But before one year when i was purchase this at cost 64000Rs... This is wrost product that i have purchase in my life.... please do not purchase this product... This is waste of money....."
2564,5,Perfect
2565,5,Awesome product Thanks Flipkart Delivered also in Lockdown period .
2566,4,I have bought this for 51K. best price and best choice.
2567,5,"Not as good as other model of mac book air, motherboard get crash in just 4month."
2568,5,As seen and shown in product image display exactly same product arrived. Highly recommended to put a screen guard along with the skin cover for any further scratch on the body of the product Otherwise too good product to use.
2569,5,"product is awesome as it is Apple products , but taking from. Flipkart is not good"
2570,1,don't buy MacBook from flipkart
2571,5,"Awesome price, Awesome product, Value for money. Flipcart delivered BEFORE time. Thanks a ton."
2572,5,Hi Team Battry Bacup not giving
2573,1,charget not found
2574,4,All are good but large excel files are not open in number application. Need to download MS office for work . Only this the main problem otherwise its a mind blowing product
2575,5,"Awesome product, I bought this laptop on Big billion days, I got for 50k, wherein there was extra 10% off on only HDFC card which I didn't possess, so have to bear the pain of paying extra 5k.  product is worth of paying so much and also performance is good, if your thinking to buy personal laptop for atleast 2 - 3 years without any hassle then this is the right product."
2576,2,I think window is better system Crashes
2577,4,product is good and is performing well with latest OS Packing was very good and delivered safe..
2578,5,Very nice product apple MacBook air
2579,5,Superb product
2580,2,Nice but build quality of macbook air is not as robust as before. Backplate knocks when u hold it in hands. It knocks continuously when u use it in bed or Diwan cot. Absolutuley annoying for this half lakh worth product.
2581,3,"Pros Delivery on time. Awesome laptop in terms of speed, performance, battery back is just superlative..runs thru the day on a single charge even a mobile phone battery doesnt last as long in most cases.  Cons But the laptop screen hinge is loose, on minor movement of the laptop the screen flips back. one of the usb port has some issue, two clips/strips of metals in it are not in line with the slot and therefore difficult to insert pen drive/hdd."
2582,5,The macmachine is awesome but the delivery by Ekart logistic was pathetic.The delivery guy named Ramakant was rude that can not be expressed.Only in Indian companies this kind of employees can be seen.Foreign companies will not hire such kind of staff who will destroy the fame and image of the brand towards the customer.
2583,4,1 star cut for non availability of CD player in MacBook otherwise awsum
2584,5,My love..... Simply awesome performance new macbook air 2017
2585,5,Small and elegant laptop that can carry anywhere you want. Powerful machine. Awesome design
2586,5,Amazing machine. Absolutely love using the MacBook.Great battery backup.Very advanced engineering is involved in this machine.Just go for it.
2587,5,Stunningly superb
2588,1,I buy this one here on flipkart on oct 17 th i have warntry i didnt use much also but the apptronix guy is saying that it is liquid damage warrantry wont cover wrost product ever dont buy any apple products on online
2589,1,MAC is not for India because most of supporting app and software are not working with mac operating system. Therefore apple should bring laptop with window Microsoft or substitute of Mac so that we can use. otherwise it is only box. Another point I want to add that b2 b GST invoice is not issuing to customer. Although they are charging GST. not issuing of B2B GST invoice is red alert...??
2590,1,bettery performance not upto the mark
2591,4,It's a good product but not value for money
2592,3,Still using it almost like 1 year  Battery is best in the work   Rayanmotovlog summer vlog YouTube
2593,5,It's performance is so consistent and optimised.. it is almost unbelievable.. it performs better than my pc with i5 10th gen
2594,4,"Happy with product, but have issues on battery backup... Soon I will visit apple store... But I think flipkart member can look this matter seriously.. For future improvements"
2595,5,"the best option for the ones looking to buy a machine with a good battery backup and do editing and stuff. It's overall good for everything, if it's a movie or music, it will fit well. Yes, you can't play games, its a mac. other than that, it wont disappoint you."
2596,1,Battery backup is 3~4 hrs and this was not accepted by apple. No return option from flipkart.
2597,1,not good quality
2598,5,awesome product saves lot of time
2599,1,Product is not user friendly no lan port at all. More over the return scheme from Flipkart not allow you to return if u r not satisfied.
2600,1,In 10 days my os freezes and crashes this is very very very bad experience.this problem is solve by apple customer service but my important data is lost mahine is very good but update all app and system is necessary
2601,3,"1.Performance is awesome 2.battery back is just 4-5 hrs..if u r playing games, battery drains fast..limited gaming support.. 3.good for professional and basic uses.. 4.display, sound quality is good.. 5.overall product is good except battery backup as mentioned in product description 10-12hrs I did not get till now. 6.it gets heated sometimes when using android studio emulators and when multiple chrome tabs(more than 10 tabs) are opened"

I bought apple products in USA too and never faced any quality or service issue. Se...

I truly regret buying it from here. Flipkart sells defective products. This one was a replacement, still it didn't work.  I will never recommend flipkart to anyone."

2641,5,"I had purchased it in Nov. 2020 a& today is 7 June 2021. Major points for the exellent performance :) Pt. 1 -> Make sure you are in a cool room while using the mac because it comes with the thermal cooling. Pt. 2 -> try not to upgrade you software to Big sur if it comes with Catilina. As you will face Battery drain issue sometimes. Pt. 3 -> You can continuously use your mac upto 6-7 hours. (Browsing, Movie, Youtube,Netflix etc.)"

2655,5,"Excellent product by mean of design, power, efficiency. I am not a big supporter of the Apple products since it's service model. But, this product is very precise in every manner (convince, battery backup, processor speed, look, adepter). Only one thing i.e. storage space is little bit small. Rest is fine. At this price ( 58000 Rs) this product is nice."

2685,5,Just Amazing
2686,5,Good
2687,5,Loved the product. Everything is cool about this laptop. I got macbook air with laminating apple logo design at the back of display. I liked it
2688,4,Though it's an old version but working well. Switching from Window to Mac was completely new experience but loved it. My daughter is enjoying her online class from mobile to Mac... Camera and sophisticated charger still a concern but overall deserve ****
2689,3,ROM is less due to which it run slow.
2690,5,This is the last macbook that you can buy which can be repaired by outside technician. I got my old one repaired 3 times. The newer macbooks are literally unrepairable by third parties. So if you are buying a macbook and do not want to spend extra with apple guys. go for this one.
2691,5,Hard to get familiarised first. Memory space is an issue. Overall good experience

2733,1,"Battery issue....MacBook Air battery lasts upto 10-12 hrs but my laptop's battery lasts only upto 4 hrs, with normal work."
2734,5,Everything is fine in this because u know very well this is APPLE. 100/100
2735,3,Display viewing angle is very bad. 10 Hours battery backup is not true. Only 6-7 hour battery backup. I'm using only browser & documents work.  Apart from this.. Good laptop for day to day usage.  THE BEST mouse trackpad. Great keyboard.
2736,5,Just Wow
2737,5,Got it delivered at 16th Nov 2020 After 2 week of usage I am writing the review.. Design is good. Its far far better than windows PC of 16gb RAM. Very elegance.

Overall I am pretty happy with the product.
2738,5,Super
2739,5,Amazing.

2741,4,Fine
2742,2,Okay
2743,5,"Superb laptop.. Writing review after using a laptop for 7 days. In terms of performance, this is the best laptop u can get in this price range. For coding and business purpose this is a powerful machine. Video editing up to HD can be done easily but 1080p,4k is not preferable on this laptop. Not suitable for games."
2744,5,excellent product and also flipkart service.
2745,4,Awesome..worth every penny
2746,5,Very nice genuine products
2747,5,Awesome

2749,5,"Macbook is undoubtedly the best laptop, Flipkart deal was mindblowing."
2750,5,Product is awesome but flipcart service is worst.. waited almost 10 days
2751,5,A great product!! Came with good packaging and delivered within 4 days!! Quite a laptop!! Love it
2752,5,Nice product
2753,5,A nic packing the packing is very good and I txn to flipcart fro the wolderfull product and there safety measures
2754,1,Got damaged product
2755,4,"It's awesome heating should be resolve, otherwise all is well"
2756,5,The product is no doubt superb but the exchange policy of Flipkart is worst. I had a very bad experience this time. Even I plan to cancel the order. The wish master or the guy who come for exchange is only giving 2000/- of my old laptop where as I am expecting 8500/- for the exchange value. The guy later confirm that we never give customer to there desired value. Finally I end up with cash value for the order and plan to sell my old laptop myself

2830,5,I have macbook Pro from organization but let me tell you this product is no less. Apple touch and feel is amazing. It may be 10k costly than other I5 products like dell etc but worth it.
2831,5,"A macbook at this price is a steal but it's not useful for anything other than light browsing, working on ms office (will have to spend extra on that) and other light applications. This is a 2017 model with an older gen processor. It might get Big Sur but any update beyond that is a question mark. Also the display tech is very old. However, The build quality and light weightedness is better than even double priced windows ones. If you are light user and and a new/old apple convert then go for..."

2855,5,"Read it carefully!  Before going to buy a Laptop full with new specifications, just remember one thing; ""Apple sabka baap hai"". My Macbook Air was manufactued on September, 2020 and the best part is it comes with Mac OS Catalina. I upgraded it to Mac OS Big Sur. Believe me, there is even no lag while even importing or exporting videos in iMovies (jo nhi jante ho, yea KineMaster ka baap hai, apple ka apna in-built app). Literally, I am getting 12 hours of battery. There is no issue of heating...."

2884,4,I had recently purchase this Macbook Air 2017 model on 21st October. I was concerned by reading online reviews about this seller TrueComRetail.  I received the product on 28th october.

2893,5,I am happy. This device is really good. Design was really very cool. Light weight. I love this.
2894,4,Purchased during Flipkart Big Billion Days 2020. No doubt mac is always a best choice as far as it's performance is concerned. Found only 2 cons. 1. Battery is giving hardly 6 hrs backup. I was expecting minimum 8 hrs backup with my limitation usage as browsing and YouTube. 2. Adapter gets heated very high whenever I charged in 1 shot from 10% to 90% .  Rest everything is Good.
2895,4,Awsm!

2920,4,"There is absolutely no comparison between MAC & Windows. This is the best operating system in terms of performance, durability & battery backup which is very well complemented by it's asthetics.  Packaging is top notch (as expected)  What is astonishing for me is the delivery time and below average customer service. This is indeed an area worth looking at. Hope Flipkart take necessary actions to ensure product should reach within the date of commitment."

2923,5,One if the best purchase
2924,5,Excellent!I'm a windows laptop user.wanted something sturdy.bought this.does the job well.one needs to buy office365 separately!comes with OS catalina. I'm not sure if 128 GB would be enough for everyone so an additional storage expense should be kept in mind.battery back up is good.
2925,2,After 6 months of use the laptop gets overheated so much and lags also.Also tally doesn't work in this.The battery in the start is so amazimg but after 6 months of use it drains like heavy rain.

2930,5,I got a recent and Aug manufactured Macbook and not from old stock. Only problem I can see in 15 days usage is that the power adapter/brick is getting very hot while charging despite it being the new MagSafe 45W power adapter. I raised the issue with Apple Care but yet to get any satisfactory resolution.

3003,5,Loveliest Mac‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
3004,5,I brought it in big billion days of 55000 rupees. I am the lucky one who get it in 2019 as apple upgrade Mac book air in 2020 and now old version is not produce by company. This is best Mac book for students. None of windows laptop can beat the performance of this Mac book in same cost. And of course Mac operating system is more powerful as compared to windows in terms of coding or video editing.
3005,5,Worthy of money
3006,5,Awesome apple product. But I don't know how it's possible. I got sealed box but when I opened it I have found some scratches on the charger.
3007,5,Toooo good ... Can't believe this lappy is thinner than my realme smartphone
3008,5,Fall in love with this
3009,5,Good
3010,1,Received a Macbook with a big scratch on the back of display. I have applied for a replacement.
3011,5,üëçüëçmust have even its 2020
3012,5,Performance and battery are just amazing. That's all we need l.
3013,5,I am a Software Developer !! Ordered this after doing a very long research. Good for everything !! Nice battery (will update after 1-2months). Display is also good. One can use external monitor for photo or video editing. Go for it guys.  Will update a details review after using it for long time.
3014,5,Superb quality ‚ù§Ô∏è it
3015,5,Reviewing after one year of use. Pros- 1.Best performance and around 7-8 hours battery. 2.Best software experience.  Cons- 1.Bezels are slightly bigger as compared to other laptops. 2.You can't play games in this laptop because it's macosüòÅ .  Overall the best laptop for students for coding and video editing.
3016,5,Nice product
3017,5,"Great product, my daughter love it."
3018,5,Best
3019,5,Just wow... Awesome Apple Mackbook. Thank you Flipkart.
3020,5,very code lp
3021,5,"Good, value for money"
3022,5,Worth
3023,5,Mac‚ù§Ô∏è
3024,5,Excellent product ...but don't buy online ....go for stores ..
3025,4,"Couldn't find or get better then this. Wait for sale (offers) and buy it without thinking much if you're looking in this price segment. All features are just confined whether it is performance, speed, weight etc. Go for it."
3026,5,"Genuine product last 2 years I'm using. Thanks, Flipkart"
3027,5,Good
3028,5,"Best to use, work like a smartphone, so light and user friendly"
3029,5,I just love its battery backup. 12 hrs ‚ù§. And on off time is also less. Worth it.
3030,4,good
3031,5,The product is up to the mark and with the best performance in the league. But if you have a job of which require much more of connection and sharing then this will be a fussy for you because this require more task for that.
3032,5,"Product is good but never buy on HDFC EMI‚Äôs option either HDFC or FLIPCART is cheating,Deducted 4 extra EMI‚Äôs and now they are blaming on each other"
3033,5,Macbook air is awesome.
3034,5,"Apple macbook air is awesome if you are College student or you are doing some kind professional stuff but not useful for account professional because many account software run in window operating system's like tally not working in mac,Dsc not working in mac in india many thing required window operating system so before you buy it just go through these stuff."
3035,5,It's a fantastic laptop I have ever seen. I just love it.
3036,5,Best
3037,5,Superb Performance... As always Mac
3038,5,Very good...it is mind-blowing
3039,5,Go for it if you're looking for a laptop for day to day task
3040,5,I felt battery support is not good. Rest all is very good.
3041,1,It has not been a year I bought the product. But the sound stopped working one day. Few days after the charger stopped working. The performance was good but not sure what is wrong with the hardware. But it's a big dissapointment.
3042,5,Good
3043,5,It‚Äôs simply best feeling to use apple products . U could find the laptop distinct and variable from other laptop brands . Overall excited using the laptop every day .
3044,5,Rating this after 10 months. Bought for 64000rs. Delivery: Before time & perfect packaging. Software installation: They never force installation. Speed: Perfect speed as can be hoped from someone to obey the inputs. Battery life: 8-9+ hours after continuos surfing using wifi. As I had to do surfing most of the time. Sound quality: Speakers be like-find me if you can..As they are beneath the keyboard and provide perfect quality more than enough someone can hope for from this tiny piece of meta...
3045,5,Great product. Just loving it.
3046,5,Nice
3047,5,Go for it giving this revoew after 2 months .. very light weight.. once u will start using ig. U will know why apple.. üòÇüòÇ
3048,1,The worst product I have purchased in my life. Mother board corrupted in less than 2 years. I had to replace it for 20k. This is worst than a Chinese product. They are looting u on the basis of name only. It's better to buy HP product. Atleast they cost less and work fine for years.
3049,3,Quite good but you can get better specifications laptop in the same price.
3050,4,"After 10 Days of use,  Battery - screen time is around 6to7 hours. This is a concern.  OS updated from the mentioned to different.  Hope rest is well..... I will need some more time to detail more."
3051,5,sometimes the speakers are not working
3052,5,Overall its good but gets too overheated. Fan sound is very loud. Unexpected.
3053,5,Best for coders just loved the trackpad and the stability screen is not a problem if u are stopped by the screen the go for it its not the problem!!
3054,4,"It is a nice product, i did not notice any issues as of now"
3055,1,I bought it in 2018 but now not working at all. use other app(Amazon) for buying
3056,5,Very good
3057,5,Good Product.
3058,3,"Had purchased it in January and was working well for four months. The physical condition was good after a few months of usage. But suddenly it stopped booting properly, showed battery and heating issues. Tried resolving the issue by doing smc reset but it didn't work. Got a diagnosis done from one of the service centers and the problem was with its main board. Just four months of use and there were problems already!"
3059,5,Beautiful
3060,5,"Best laptop ever, class design, it is sleek and thin. It has fastest OS in the world. It is not just a laptop,but it is an experience."
3061,5,Bought MacBook air 2 years back. Working fine.Love it's sleek design
3062,1,My Macbook Air Camera is very bad. I think my laptop camera is changed by seller.
3063,4,Serial number in tax invoice and actual serial number are different. Having issue to register its warranty.  Rest everything is good.
3064,4,The laptop is beautifully designed and slick. The UI is very comfortable but the apple environment is still growing so there can be interoperability issues with other windows programs. Recently however I have been facing quality issues and had to pay to change the keyboard. With upgrade to Catalin now am facing wi fi issues. The policy of replacing parts makes maintenance very high. For the premium price we are paying I expected far better quality. So weigh the pros and cons before buying the...

3104,5,Kya bolu it's amazing laptop i ever used
3105,4,Product worth the price Good for business purposes only Not good for editing color grading video editing like that because of the display resolution
3106,4,"Best quality, worth of money."
3107,5,A wonderful product.
3108,5,"Nice strong build, unlike the pro model.Only con is there is no in-built HDMI port. I think this is the last model where the apple logo shines."
3109,5,Battery backup and performance makes me happy
3110,5,Still the best laptop if we overlook the big bezzle'e and screen quality. For getting in the Apple Kingdom its the best you can get.
3111,3,"It won‚Äôt turn on after three years from purchase date! Unfortunately, I woke up to start working and finding my MacBook Air not starting. Tried all key combination- started after a couple of hours. But next day onwards- totally conked off. Battery is okay. It‚Äôs basically a three year investment. But performed very well ! Very sad about this."
3112,1,The laptop faced numerous issues 1. Blickering of the screen while watching videos 2. The RAM stopped working within 3.5 months
3113,5,Great laptop even in 2020
3114,5,"Pros: Great for regular use,outstanding battery life, rapid charge, keyboard is smooth, trackpad is smooth, built in 128GB SSD is worth it if you are looking for long term work performance. For 66k, I would really recommend the Air. I have installed Anaconda on it and seems there has been no issue with the background code processing so far. Sound quality is very nice, placement of the speakers really does the trick.  Cons: Power adapter and bottom vent gets heated up very much"

3237,4,I bought this Laptop on Jan 2020. After 1 month of usage I feel everything is fine except the fonts.The fonts are blurry and pixeleted.After trying many methods i upgraded to Catalina but it did not resolve the issues.Looks like it's an issue with Mojave and Catalina for non-retina display.
3238,5,From 2013 I am using only Lenovo series laptop booted with Linux. Needed a new laptop so opted for this. very surprised with the smoothness the laptop runs.As for the SSD for more storage you can take a external hard disk. Very good buy

3255,2,Dear all. When I placed the order I was very confused about the quality and authenticity of the product. So after receiving the package I directly went to the Apple service Center and got my Mac book check. It is 100%genuine product.
3256,5,just amazing than i expected..it is just crowd puller laptop when you go to public places.feels so premium no windows laptop can compete this laptop in design performance .

3261,5,what can be better
3262,5,Apple is Awesome As Always. If You Wish To Go Blind üòÄ
3263,5,Overall performance is superb but display is disappointing. If one can manage with inferior display quality than it is a must go laptop at 50k range.
3264,5,"fits well for the price. The quality is hands down amazing. If you carry your laptop a lot, this is a lifesaver. For the purpose of video editing as well, fits perfect!"
3265,4,No worry if You are a professional otherwise it might be little fuzzy but overall only of its kind
3266,5,Value for money.

3849,2,best performance good quality
3850,4,Display panel in this laptop is quiet outmode with 1400x900 pixel panel in the HD bezzelless and 1080 pixel panels. Another con is the hard drive is formatted in fat encryption which makes it a cumbersome task to transfer files from your mac book to other storage devices be it pendrive hard disk etc unless they too are encrypted in fat format. The processing speed is quiet fast battery back up is excellent. Hard disk read and write speed is awesome. The laptop is compact and sleek easy to carry.
3851,5,Awesome product...
3852,5,High performance laptop
3853,5,Macbook Air is working fine.
3854,5,"Please do not purchase any laptop from here. I purchased a MacBook. The serial number is registered in apple the website, 3 months before. And The major problem is they are not mentioning the laptop serial number in the invoice by which you can not avail any service."

5093,4,I am happy with this laptop. Good for basic use at home. Good for kid's use also. Battery is good - runs more than 4-5 hours. Not happy with Display and no caps lock and number log indicator light.
5094,5,I have just received the laptop today and am very excited to use it.Must say that at this price range it's one of the best laptops to buy without thinking once.Must buy if you want a decent work laptop with good specifications at this price range.
5095,4,"it's quite good ,and one important thing to do while updating win 10 or download win 10 don't turn up your laptop it's quite risky when you download your update quickly install and restart it and we are thinking about display quality it's good you can also play video upto 4K on youtube but first of all I think display quality is very poor cause of TFT panel but wrong TFT panel is also good but not like that IPS .

5100,1,Its my review after used after 5 months. Its not a valuable laptop for study or any smooth working purposes. Issues: 1. Connectivity issues I m facing now. Specially usb port. 2. Battary performance was well for first 3 months. After it drains quickly without any playing video or audio. Only pdf reading it running hardly 2 hrs. 3. web camera is very bad performing like 0.3mp. 4. The processor also very slow and sometimes its hanging that one can't move for other work. 5. In sunlight one ...
5101,4,"Product was good while delivering... The laptop works slow for first two days now it is ok... I like it... In below 30,000 range laptop,this was worth with windows 10..."
5102,5,Laptop is good for kids ..school or secondary laptop for movies and also for older folks who just need connectivity.. like skype and social. For 17k this is a good deal. 1TB for storage and 4GB ram does the light lifting. Dont expect this to do any fancy gaming or programs..what you pay and the purpose is key before selecting this laptop
5103,4,"Very Good in Display Quality. keyboard /Mouse Good. Processing is something , just something slow....but its good.. Over All I found this A Great Office work Laptop , so that i want. 5 mein se phir bi 4.5 dunga.."
5104,1,The webcam quality for video calls is very bad And it takes aloot of time to open each file or folder And the display quality is not good. For basic kids use only . only look wise its good Don't buy better add little more money and buy i3/i5
5105,1,Overall below average laptop not worth buyin nothing noteworthy pretty much not worth the money Ps: not recommended to buy only if u can custom install and remove the stock parts
5106,5,Best laptop in given prize range..battery was gud but processor running slow..overall laptop was good for simple works
5107,4,"overall good... value for the price ...but not for heavy works .. it's ok for basic works like web browsing, emails, office works - excell, word etc."
5108,5,"Nice product for normal & jenuine home use only , and value for money. Proud on me for good choice"
5109,5,It's a decent product at a price of 20000. Does the job at the price point. Dont expect it to behave like i5 or i3. But overall good product
5110,5,1. Delivery was sooo fast.... Thanks a lot for that. Seller and Ekart.  2. Design- Good and weight also perfect for carrying.  Keypad color is not adjusted as per the product color. It is very problematic to use. No capslock indicator as well as numlock indicator. All USB ports are in one side.  3. Screen - Very good. It's carefully for eye. Very soft looking. Display quality is very good.  5. Performance- Good. Little bit slow to open excel those are greater than 1mb.  6. Battery - Not good...
5111,5,"Amazing product under this price range. It's stylish design, powerful processor and budget friendly is perfect for basic use. Really thankful to flipkart for delivering this amazing product on time."

5133,1,Laptop stopped responding from today (purchase date 29 Dec 2019)
5134,1,Don't ever buy this product trust me you will suffer later...don't buy this product
5135,1,The laptop wont start when received. Flipkart has some misleading claims as now they say that replacement will be done only after Asus technician visits and checks the laptop. So one will end up wasting time and will have to deal with unnecessary haggling for no fault except buying a lemon product from Flipkart. Pathetic fine prints policy.
5136,4,Good

5168,1,"Absolutely waste of money. Do not buy this laptop. It's so slow that you can literally miss whole class by the time it boots and connects. It cannot perform basic documentation even with minimal needs, you can finish 2 cups of tea by the time it is loading applications. Restarting this is absolutely headache and just keep seeing the circle in front. Sometimes it appears that there is no processor inside. Bought it for kids online class with basic functionality but my 'chintoo' threw on day on..."
5169,1,"Waste product, always hanging while starting the windows it's keep on hanging, packing also very worst.. Please don't buy the product by seeing the photos and features, going to return the product"
5170,1,Don't even consider this laptop just for cheaper rate. This laptop is a trap in this rate. Just after 3 day use . The laptop now don't even turns on. If by chance it turns on by mistake u can't see anything all blank .

5174,1,Late delivery of a crucial product ! Caps lock key doesn't even have a light to indicate if it's on unless we type and find it out! Neither invoice nor guarantee card provided. Slow performance and average battery life.
5175,5,Nice laptop . I am writing this after 15 day use. Best at this price
5176,2,Very slow processing speed.
5177,1,"Not at all happy with the product as the keyboard is uplifted as in the keys are coming out, it hangs and works very slow while using Excel and inspite of being a brand new laptop it restarts very slowly. Have no option other than getting it as replacement as per the sellers policy. So waiting for replacement to come and see what happens with it."

5192,5,Thankyou flipcart
5193,1,Do not buy this..you will feel it is value for money but you do not get anything. The speed and performance is horrible. You cannot even open 2 tabs at a time. I tried to increase RAM but cannot do it as it has 4 GB inbuilt RAM and you can only add SSD which is costly. They lied that you can increase the RAM by 16 GB but you cannot
5194,1,Laptop is not turned on after 20 usage and waste of money. ASUS support team is too lazy and no response from them
5195,2,Not upto that i want and i think so much slow processor don't buy please if you have budget then only purchase another lap top don't purchase this one with low budget

However, If Asus can reduce the size which will look attractive, whole plastics is been used instead if they could have used metal, that would be essential. In India we all need low cost laptops for school or small business purpose. And a one more feature essential can make this laptop popular is the backlights in the keyboard.  No company pays attention to ..."

5248,3,"Overall I would grade it 3/5. Display colours are very dim may be because of anti glaze screen. Storage is pitiable.... even my 7 years old Lenovo has got better storage than it.

5789,1,1. Very slow. 2. Audio visual problem. 3. Key board is not visible if sitting properly. One will have to bend the neck and body to see keyboard.

5922,1,I have been most unlucky to book this trusting Asus over Acer and others. I was fascinated by the configuration and the comments out here but that's just marketing stunt. Felt deeply sorry for my cousin for whom I booked this. 1. CD/DVD Rom makes hell lot of noise. 2. Booting time is more than 15 mins. 3. The speed of clicking any button is sluggish. 4. This is sick laptop even for office use.

6286,4,"Good laptop for the money. Windows is unusable for me with default configuration (HDD, 4Gb ram). Upgrade ram as soon as you get it for better performance on dual channel memory. There is one empty ram slot and Lenovo manual says upto 12Gb total ram is supported. That is 8 GB ram can be installed in the slot. I've only added 4g. Please remember that 2Gb will be dedicated to the GPU and there's no option in bios to change this. So I had only 6Gb available ram for programs and services. It has o..."

6289,3,"So the very first thing is 4gb ram which is way too low to do anything on this stylish and slim laptop. But thankfully it comes with an empty slot for the same. I had to buy kingston ddr4 8gb 2666mhz ram for Rs.2500 to actually get this laptop to work as otherwise it would utilize 80-85% ram on just opening a web browser. 8gb is the maximum additional upgrade allowed. You can buy 2400mhz or 2666mhz. Apart from that, you get original windows and ms office at this price! Antiglare screen is goo..."
6290,3,First of all I got this gadget in a very low price which was a cool deal with this specifications. No doubt specs are too good but here are some pros and cons after usage of two weeks approx.  Pros:  Design is really good and keys are smooth  Storage is also good  RAM  Genuine windows 10  Genuine microsoft office  AMD ryzen 3 processor  Light weight  Big display  Sound quality is crisp at a defined point  Battery charging time is almost 3 to 3.5 hours from 0 to 100  AMD enabled radeon graphic...
6291,4,Got this laptop in 24000 only . Best laptop For personal nd simple work . But If you want to do heavy work then you should buy SSD RAM variant for fast performance. Which having cost of 28000 I think . Overall good laptop Battery backup is 2-2.5 hours if you continuously use it.
6292,5,It's a great laptop I got it under 29k best buy for me and just add 4gb ram to it and see the magic happen it's too good
6293,4,"Product is worth five stars for the price of 22k-24k. Though I bought this @29k during lockdown since my old laptop crashed. If you can wait for the price drop to 22k-24k, go for this without any second thought. But for the price of @29k, i would recommend to go for ASUS having same specs but much better battery backup.  Pros: 1. Design is good, display is good. 2. Ryzen 3 is much better compared to i3 7th gen. 3. Comes with MS office 4. Speakers are good.  Cons: 1. Mouse touch pad is n..."
6294,4,"I am using this laptop since 1year. No complaints. Running perfectly. But it is little bit slow response. It's because the storage device is hdd which has slow read rate. When I upgraded to ssd and 8GB ram , it is performance beast. It is also capable of running games in medium settings. Overall I will four star. Acer aspire 7 is more better than this. If we considering the budget. It is the best laptop"
6295,5,"I think this is one of the finest laptop i ever bought Looks good , best battery backup, performance is very fast with ryzen 3 dual core, Ryzen 3 dual core is far better than Intel i5 10th gen It will give u battery backup of around 5 hrs Go for it guys"
6296,4,"I'm gong to brief about the Pros and Cons only.  Pros - 1. Ryzen 3 Processor 2. AMD Vega 3 Graphics 3. FHD Screen 4. Light weight 5. Windows 10 and MsOffice pre installed 6. Looks  Cons - 1. Battery backup 2. TouchPad 3. Webcam  Now on a simple note for day to day office work or students assignments, surfing its a great deal. If you are thinking of gaming then don't go for it. Else product is good."
6297,4,I SO HAPPY THIS IS MY FIRST LAPTOP THANKS FLIPKART GIVE ME FAST DELIVERY AND GOOD SERVICE THERE IS NO FRAUD FROM FLIPKART YOU CAN TRUST THE FLIPKART
6298,1,I am not satisfied with this laptop.this laptop is working slow. Screen brightness is low. Speaker is not good sound is low.i get this laptop in 26k. After 1 year keyboard and touchpad not working overall i am not satisfied with this laptop.
6299,5,"Build Quality is Not so Good, Track-pad is decent enough for daily use. Performance is good considering the price Thanks to Ryzen 3 3200U (Recommend to buy Variant with Ryzen 3 4000 series). Main bottleneck for this laptop is the HDD. Because of hard disk this laptop doesn't feel snappy(AMD is not to be blamed). I recommend Upgrading to SSD or buy a variant with SSD. Display is very good with decent viewing angles. 4 Hours + battery life with fast charging."
6300,4,"Honest Review  I am writing this review after using this laptop for almost 2 months. Overall quality is average unless you have upgraded RAM. I an waiting to purchase an 8GB RAM because RAM consumption is too much by the Windows App, 600MB is reserved by hardware as well. I haven't used any SSD powered laptop so I can't say buying it will speed up your performance or not but am sure with the RAM.  So when I play game (GTA IV) on this laptop. CPU usage is always around 30%-40% RAM usage is a..."
6301,4,It's really. Value for money. Performance wise it's good. Not to expect quick boot and fast multi tasking. But it's quite ok for daily single task activities. Laptop is not much sturdy. Noisy keyboard and noisy mouse pad. Probe to Scratch. 180 degree display is very supportive and still not giving confident not over usage. Though these are all not in harsh note. It's overall good product in this price point.
6302,5,"A good laptop in the price segment . Dont exoect it to run heavy gaming or work, it's good to go for moderate users like bwosing studying and work."
6303,5,Overall a good product for this price!! Display is good. Battery backup is around 4 hours. Speaker clarity is awesome.... But not more loud. Performance is better than i3 7th gen processor. Ram upgrade is must for improving the speed of the machine.
6304,5,"A really good product considering that it's so affordable, I recommend it to anyone who needs it for basic tasks like surfing, typing, school and office work in general. However, I would recommend that you upgrade the RAM a 4GB upgrade would be ok, but I recommend adding another 8GB as a lot of it is taken by background processes (I was even able to play GTA V with the 8GB upgrade) The only little problem I have aside that is the display is a little off coloured."
6305,3,"good laptop at reasonable prices .charger size is small, but speed is not up to the mark. ok for basic college work"
6306,4,"This is a must buy laptop if you wish to get a laptop in 30k as it includes graphics too If you wish to get a laptop for normal use it is the best laptop don't go for a second think to buy this , the display and the features are ausumn  One thing you need to keep in mind is the battery it last for 2, 3 hours on heavy usage. It sometimes hangs but after updates the laptop is working fine (it's an honest review)   I am Giving the review after using the laptop for a month"
6307,4,Got this 1 in offer by flipkart big billion days for just 2500....many suggestions i received in terms of low budget laptop..but i wanted to try this product...but this has led me so far aftr months of usage..it comes with great display atleast compared to other brands in this range...but rest all depends upon the user how he manages his pc. but to me its little slow in terms of opening an application but its fine manageable...overall its the most decent 1 i came accrossin this price range.
6308,3,Worked fine till 6-7 months after that started lagging. Very slow performance. Battery backup is just 2 hours. Low end pc. Motherboard got damaged in just 11 months. The new motherboard replaced by lenovo is not working properly. I think it's not good for heavy usage. The laptop is not as good as expected.
6309,5,It's awesome laptop doing great work when u creat account first time it's take time after that it's works excellent and battery is average and I get in 25k on big billion days and it's work smoothly
6310,3,first of all battery backup is not good design is good webcam is totally poor quality low grade plastic is used so build quality is zero performance is also not so good it takes approx 40_50 seconds to boot after installing all the drivers instead go for acer aspire ryzen 3 with better build quality and performance
6311,3,"This one is good if you are looking for general usage. Ram need to be extended for better performance. Camera should be enhanced more , currently it is poor. Other than this is ok for a student."
6312,4,"It's a good laptop, ideal for students and office work. But it's not for coding and programming 4gb ram is less for this. Initially the laptops hangs and a bit slow but after all the security patch and windows update it runs completely fine. Battery life is not as good also AMD processor consume more power and camera is really bad.Also this colour gets dirty very easily. Till now I'm not finding any more problem. I'm writing this review after 10days. I got it for rs.31,990/ at this price this..."
6313,5,"It's not the best laptop I've ever used but it's certainly the best bang for buck at this price. I invested some more into the laptop (added 8gb ram, replaced hdd with ssd) and the performance shot through the roof!  I have two issues though - the display chassis is a little too flimsy (wasn't expecting much at this price anyway), and the display itself is sub-par. I had to calibrate it manually to make it bearable but all's well if ends well.  In short, you can't get anything better at this..."
6314,4,This is my first ever purchase of laptop. I am using it for last 6 months and after that I'm reviewing the product. 1. The battery performance is medium. In power saving mode the performance is better. Upto 4 to 4.5 hours. 2. The screen sometimes become grey so clarity is medium. 3. Dolby sound system is very good. 4. The touch pad system is not upto the mark. It's better to use a mouse. 5. The build quality is also good in this price. 6. For better performance you just need to upgrade the R...
6315,5,"This is not a student laptop, but I would like to say it's also for professionals.  I can perform following things very smoothly:  Web development with .net framework Adobe Photoshop Android development Multitasking Smooth video editing like filmora AutoCAD MATLAB. Etc YouTube professionals work    Below are the issues In short it is not a software developer or engineers laptop. Better you look for i7 + 16 GB ram with 500ssd  -one more thing Ryzen 3 is best as compare to i3 for sure."
6316,5,Laptop is very good performance is very good and battery performance is also nice and charging is 65 word which charge the laptop at very low time performance is super at this the price point
6317,3,Lenovo is preloaded with default apps which makes the performance slow. Better to disable all those apps not to run on the start up to improve performance. Even I was literally feeling like returning but being an engineer thought give few more days.. suggest Lenovo team also to reduce the preloaded apps or send the technician who comes and does the first time installation and set up. This might be useful for common man  Lookwise it is awesome 500+ mb is dedicated to for display So we get 3.5 ...
6318,4,"Perfect home laptop. Good graphics. And appealing outlook. 15.1inch. and compact and wonderfull. It doesn't have the CD slot. The only disadvantage I found.  Apart from that's this is good with, teams, photoshop, Adobe premiere etc. Its awesome for those type of softwares. And its like good enaf."
6319,4,"Got it for 24k, good for the mentioned price, don't go for it above 25k, good thing is it can be extended ram and SSD, display is decent and viewing angle is not upto the mark."
6320,3,"Well, using it for several days and it never disappointed me so far. I was a little bit confused about AMD but then found Ryzen 3 3200U is actually better than Intel's i3 8th gen and it can compete even 10th gen in terms of clock speed.  Looks like one must update RAM since it's 4gb isn't enough for multitasking cause it's Slow and Sometimes hangs. And for further betterment one can go for SSDs(NVMe only otherwise replace the HDD)  Display is quite decent in comparison (in that price segment)..."
6321,4,Pro Decent product and built quality compared to price of laptop. Two side bezel definitely look good. R3 is great for light work ideal for office work which doesn't involve heavy software. Most importantly it is cheaper than I3. Keypad is great and button quality and finish is goods Preinstalled Windows and MS office greatly reduce your installation hassle and makes it perfect for non-tech users.  Cons It made in China. Though it has a Graphic card it is not a gaming laptop. Screen is brigh...
6322,5,Awsome laptop in affordable range! Must good going laptop for students and basic uses! Package is nicely.. full care has been taken.. Overall its worth it!
6323,4,Laptop is Best in 27K but 4Gb Ram is not Sufficient if you are a casual user then buy it other Wise its waste of money not recommended for Gaming or Editing
6324,4,I bought this laptop in big billion day sale. It has only 4gb ram. Better to upgrade extra 4gb. After adding extra ram it's work like charm. Battery backup is not that much good. But at this price what you expect. Sound quality is very low after enabling Dolby audio. If your budget is between 25k to 34k definitely buy this one . MS OFFICE is with life time validity. And McAfee Antivirus with 1 month of trial version
6325,4,"This laptop is good for a student like working in ms excel,word,powerpoint and editing and checking email.this laptop only comes in 4gb ram whch is soldered to the motherboard so u can grab another 8gb of ram from flipkart so u can make it much more powerful but not good as expected."
6326,5,"Excellent product. Early delivery by Flipkart. Good packing. No issue in operation of machine. No issue in activating preinstalled Windows 10 and MS Office 2019. Mcphy antivirus was preinstalled aswell. Overall a good purchase in INR 24490 including one year warranty. Those who are planning to buy core i3 9th generation may consider it as it's performance is no lesser than i3 8th generation and in most of the aspects of performance and several games, it leads i3 9th generation. One more USB p..."
6327,5,"The laptop is very good in terms of daily office work and study, Do not expect it to out perform the specs. It is a decent laptop which will give you enough to get going. But if you want high speeds and extreme multi tasking, then go for a better one. If Study and office work( Spreadsheets, multiple chrome windows, drive etc.) is your concern then its just fine."
6328,5,I got this laptop in 23k in bbd sale . Design wise this is beautiful laptop but handle with extra care Display of this laptop is not bad it is full hd and too bright but viewing angle make me unhappy other wise gud display.

6329,4,This review is based on few hrs use without any more aap download pre installed windows 10 and ms office this is great but I check battery very keenly because battery is main component of laptop. Use only screen with internet for video backup is 3:30hrs . Use any task with involved processor power . Backup time is 1:45Hrs which is not gud but in this Corona time all laptops and mobile are very high in price no laptops offer this type of specification in this price range design is ok not ...
6330,5,I purchased it for my younger one. Performance is pretty good and I like the way it is slim and handy at this price range.  Recommended product.!
6331,3,"The feel and design is pretty sleek and its genuinely light weighted. Battery performance is average but its good for office work &/or for Work from Home purpose. Biggest down side is that the speakers in this laptop is very low. Ryzen 3 vs Intel 3 was a challenge but if you are saving 2-3K with Ryzen, go for it. Overall satisfied with the product."

6387,2,After 2 month uses it slow.googl app hi 5 se 10 minute mein open hota hai.
6388,4,Best one to this price (23k) the main dispointment was ram its only 4gb. Due to this less ram performance get little bit lower
6389,1,The battery even after charging 100% does not stay for even for 35mins.
6390,5,"Worthy purchase even in 28k. All-rounder performance. Added extra 4GB DDR4 2400 RAM + NVMe m2 128 GB SSD. Now it loads four times faster than out of the box speed. Recommends for students , programmers and media streamers. Yet it plays most of the games having mid range graphics, not recommends for gaming or studio editing purposes."
6391,3,The laptop if using for multitasking without gaming then it needs to upgraded with SSD/RAM.  Else it will take few minutes to open applications and multitasking is very difficult especially if you are online and presenting.
6392,1,"Don't think of buying this product. Trust me, you will regret to the deepest point. Highly disappointed with not just Lenovo but Flipkart too."

6396,5,It is to good product but one problem is there its battery backap is poor
6397,3,Average laptop. Don't expect it to be decent quick. Opens up applications after more than 30 secs. Would not recommend it for heavy or moderate use.
6398,1,"System performance is really pathetic. For opening one web browser will take 5 minutes after clicking it. Not installed any softwares other than operating system and related files. As per lenova service desk, RAM need to upgrade. But i dont think so. Looks like something abnormal with the laptop. Money wasted."
6399,3,4GB RAM IS NOT ENOUGH FOR THIS DEVICE. IT SHOULD BE INCREASED UP TO 8GB AS SOME PROGRAMS TAKE LONGER TIME IN STARTING.

6402,1,"Don't purchase this laptop, running very slow after 1-2 week use"

6405,1,Laptop is too slow. Even windows 98 pc is faster than this laptop.
6406,1,Within 8 months keyboard is not working properly Full of hang problem s don't by this don't even where to complaint
6407,1,Laptop functioned only for8 months. Never ever buy e-goods thru Flipkart. They won't provide any after sales services. I reported the matter to Flipkart and Lenovo but the matter not cleared even after two weeks.l lost my money.
6408,2,If you sleep this laptop and reopen it takes 30 to 100sec It's very slow Not value for money after 1 month
6409,1,This laptop is very slow working. It taking 3 minutes for starting window. And after start its work Very slow. My money waste for this laptop. I never suggest to any one for buy this laptop.
6410,1,Worst product. Don't buy it. Very slow laptop. Don't waste your money. Go for dell or hp
6411,4,A best laptop at this range... It is very stylishly designed..... Display is good.... Amd ryzen 3 and 8th gen Mcafee is free for one month but they have mentioned 1 year..... Defects are: A cheap quality battery Battery life is tooo low.... Sound quality is bad..... They have mentioned dolby audio but it's tooooo low.... Camera quality poooor.. üò¨ Except this it's the.... Best.... Don't worry just buy it‚ù§üòç
6412,5,Just Upgrade RAM To 8gb and see the performance!!! Budget Gaming!!!
6413,3,"The laptop is very slow and gets stuck a lot but...you can get rid of that problem if you increase the Random Access Memory. In the beginning my laptop was performing extremely slow. Then I added 8GB of the memory (Crucial Brand) and after that the performance improved significantly. 4GB of the memory is inbuilt, so if you add 8GB of that, the memory will become 12GB, which is enough for even gaming. Ryzen 3 processor is nice. So without the increased memory, the Laptop is trash but after you..."
6414,1,Performance is very poor. The newest laptop hangs so badly
6415,2,One of the worst laptops I have seen. It doesnt give the performance of Ryzen 3 processor. It is running far too slow than expected. Dont ever buy this laptop never look at 3.9 rating. Only way to make this laptop work good is to upgrade the RAM. Also the battery is too low. Power only lasts for 2.5 hours. This review is given after first time use. Also disk usage shows 10% in a brand new laptop.
6416,2,Very slow..if you open anything it takes lots of time to open...but other than that it's good...sound is very less..picture quality is nice.. although it's not up to the mark..next time if I buy laptop I'll definitely go for intel processor...AMD is worst
6417,5,Fabulous design with great keypad and touchpad
6418,2,"Very slow processing,less battery backup Don't go with this laptop if u want to do heavy tasking. It takes time to even open Google Chrome."
6419,1,Simply waste
6420,5,"This is best under budget and value for money , for better speed increase the RAM since it's only 4 gb"
6421,3,Laptop is slow but if you are going for this consider upgrading RAM to 8 or 12 gb else go for 4gb 256 ssd or 8gb 1tb hdd. After upgrade it works like a charm.
6422,5,Best in the segment....strong build quality even it is plastic made.....4 gb ram a bit sluggish because amd processor is damn good for it to use resources but chrome is a Ram- hungry devil ... Replace chrome with opera and install 8 gb of 2400 Mhz ram from crucial.....install additional ram will boost it ....go for it..if u want premium looks and best performance üòçüòç
6423,3,"Ifter 5 days of use .... Taking time to boot up , performance is ok ok , rest all good ...."
6424,3,Only design is good in this laptop others things are worst the performance is very slow its taking too much time to open apps and it is hanging too much .and battery is also dropping very fast. I got very bad experience in this laptop.this is not value for money.
6425,4,"Good Entry Level laptop for everyday use. Just one suggestion, go for 8 gb Ram...or upgrade it later."
6426,4,Everything is fine. Note - need a ram (must) and ssd(optional) to work otherwise it's slow and also release heat.
6427,4,McAfee comes with 30 days subscription so I'm very sad
6428,5,Go for it.
6429,5,Good
6430,5,Nice
6431,4,Nice
6432,5,Osome product
6433,5,Nice
6434,4,Good laptop in this budget...
6435,5,Awesome
6436,1,"Value for Money, Pros: No heating problem, Low cost, Light weight, looks attractive, pre installed Office home student edition, 1 year unlimited device antivirus protection.  Cons: Slow, cant run heavy processes, no gamming please. Slow speed can be overcome to some extent by adding 8 GB Ram  re-rated to 1* Reason - Head phone jack loose connection is not covered under warranty plus service centre lacks staff who can fix it."
6437,3,Little bit slower but value for money
6438,4,Very nice performance. Should buy....üëåüèº

6447,5,Good
6448,5,Nice product
6449,3,It's an average product.. In this price range I would also suggest to see other alternatives.. Battery backup is less Display is good It lags in between We have to increase the RAM for better performance No slot for LAN cable No USB slot in right of the laptop.. slots are in left side Cursor button pad is bit stiff.
6450,4,Best buy for this budget

6463,5,Good time delivery....
6464,1,"I bought this laptop after seeing its features and thought that it is a good laptop in a low budget. But that was my mistake. Bad things: sound is very low (speakers are not that good). The system is extremely slow, it takes a very long time to start. It started to hang within 1 month (even I didn't installed any other software or game in it). The speed of system is very very slow. Even to see photographs or to transfer files in other folders it takes a lot of time. Good things: FHD, design i..."

6475,3,Ok
6476,4,"BEWARE!!!: MS office is only trial version of 7 days. When you ask about this with seller, they directly initiate returning of laptop. Crazy way of customer support.  But the laptop is awesome. For the price it's awesome. I upgraded it with 4GB additional RAM and 3 years Kaspersky Antivirus. Now it's one rocking machine...  I actually bought 2 laptops . One for sis and another one for dad. Because i liked it so much."
6477,3,"Design is good , battery life also not bad approx 4 hours or max (on normal working ) , performance is not really speed but in this range good"

6503,2,"Sluggish performance, not at all good display. Poor sound quality and poor camera. Even if only Chrome is open, it would not be possible to open another application quickly. Not sure how come so many people rated it so high. It has only given me more stress than any delight of buying a new product.  Flipkart accepted to pick up the product and issue refund. I think they would have repacked and sold it to someone else and because of which the other person would have also gone through the same..."
6504,2,"I just use this product only 2 days. previously i used Hp intel pentium gold, since i used my old laptop 7 year's. and i feel more comfortable also have good battery back up. come to lenovo its take time to reboot the app's. also worst battery max 2.5- 3 yrs depend on works. also you cant use multi task at the time. come to processor compared to intel pentium gold, AMD ryzen not yet good. i suggesting in this budget you can get Hp brand laptop."
6505,5,Super laptop NYC look

6515,2,Device speed is very slow not up to level doesn't worth for price
6516,1,Battery power is low...fan sound is high... don't buy this product
6517,3,It hangs a most while..better to get upgraded ram to 8 g or 12 gb then there could be some hike in performance..
6518,5,Much more better than Intel i3 processor Best budget laptop .......
6519,3,I hate it. Its performance is very slow. It takes too much time open Ms excel. Now think about about the other applications. Think before you purchase this laptop.
6520,2,PC is very slow. Brought based on review from you tube. All are fake a good laptop will cost more. I can't even use smoothy for Normal office work. Any applications take at least 10-15 seconds for opening.

6535,4,Fair product in this price range.
6536,1,Worst laptop I ever had...it's slower than a tortoise. Stupid thing takes 10 minutes to start and 15 minutes to shut. No laptop service station is understanding the problem and asking more money to improvise the hardware. Worst decision ever.

6555,2,Worst laptop. Very slow performance.
6556,2,I purchased this laptop because of it's price but now I think it was a big mistake if you are reading this I request you not to purchase it. It is extremely slow and it's battery life is really bad. It gets irritating at time because it is too slow. And hang even while using a normal search engine. It would be better if you spend more 10000 and buy a better machine
6557,4,Very nice products
6558,5,"That's value for money......it's not a high performance machine but it's excellent in office,students,home usage,coding,light gameing,watching online content like Amazon prime videos,Netflix...ect.

I will not at all recommend this worst product. Please Don't go with rating and reviews. Check the performance lively before purchase it.

6621,4,All I can say it's good but it is laggy and sometimes you may have to power off.I have bought it recently and although good but speakers have less volume. Camera quality good and battery is although not very good just fine and value for money and it is good option to buy. In budget range it is good to have and a good option.

6712,4,Value product but you need to install ssd for better performance
6713,3,"After lot of research, I have bought it but the performance is not good, and it takes time to start up. Even sometimes when open a new tab its keep rolling up. The design looks fine."

6721,2,It is started hanging problem from very second use of it
6722,4,"Everything is good till now Battery could be better And The max briteness is not up to the need , it feels low when sunlight comes, could be 2 or 3 point more Else good One more complain why the hell price suddenly decreases from 30990 to 28990 after placing the order, it's unfair"
6723,2,Very Bed experience with processing and battery capacity.
6724,5,Good
6725,3,"You should add 8gb ram,or else its waste,it not 8gb ram i will compare it to pentium processor"
6726,3,"Very slow device. Even if you want to use it for educational purposes, jts not useful as it runs very slow. Now i need to spend extra to upgrade it with SSD memory or RAM"
6727,2,"Not satisfied,,,"
6728,5,Some time it very slow working and battery Draining so fast but in this price it is a valuable laptop.
6729,1,Hanging problem
6730,3,Better to buy laptop with 8 gb ram. Display is good. Performance slow with 4 gb ram.
6731,1,"Lot of noise was coming from fan+cpu assembly of laptop. So I have returned it. Also had issues with battery, only 2.5 hrs time with battery. Heating issues were also there."
6732,4,Very slow
6733,1,Veru slow laptop dont buy it !!!!!
6734,3,Very slow
6735,3,Cheap and best. Home and Student purpose ok.
6736,4,It does its job and is a good budget laptop but do keep in mind that it is not meant for gaming and adding extra 8gb RAM (as i did) gives much more stable perfomance.... I got it for 25k for that price its absolutely great!
6737,3,It's getting fan sound heavy
6738,5,Nice product
6739,1,Worst performance
6740,4,Good.......
6741,4,Only problem is battery drain fastly. Otherwise best product. Worth buying at this price
6742,3,"This is a entry level budget laptop and even has a good performance due to the AMD processor, gaming might be twitchy while playing mediocre game but handles every day daily task easily but might be a bit slow while multitasking, overall it is not 5 star but a manageable lap for students and entry level laptop learners I would say"
6743,4,Display and built quality could have been better ... over All ok for that price ...
6744,5,It is good for free fire üî•üî•üî•
6745,1,Poor defect product
6746,1,"Very bad quility product crusher/mouse stop working in middle of work every day ,also function key not working like F1& F2 ,f3 not working without press fn key,speed is too slow hanging problem"
6747,5,Nice laptop took for my brother.
6748,2,Perfomance is so bad. I can't even use the mouse properly. Only the design is good
6749,3,Starting it was okay but as days passed its geeting slow. After opening application its doing good. But it lags while opening the application
6750,4,Good laptop for mid range users not good for gaming. But no lag.
6751,3,It is a 'kaam chalau' laptop. Bought it for my Dad. The only thing he doesn't like about it is its trackpad which feels weird and too plasticy so we use a external mouse.
6752,3,Battery down fast.. Works slow Hanging many times As per this drawbacks price is very high.dont buy.
6753,5,Using from 2 months no issue occurred till now. Processor are good for this price. If you want to use for your online classes then go for it
6754,1,Worst product.. Huge fan sound within one month. No proper support from flipkart.
6755,3,Dear team no body help me for system installation please help me
6756,5,"Very good Product and features also stylish design, Full HD display etc."
6757,3,Not that great. Expected better performance from the specifications of the laptop.
6758,3,Average performance.. Look and feel nice...
6759,4,This laptop is very good at this price range but if you'll need onsite support then I must say their customer support is terrible unless you live in a developed area.
6760,1,Very slow and the keyboard is bad and fan sound coming inside overall very bad product Totally irritated by buying this product
6761,5,"It is just fine for everyday use. Working nice and fast as expected. You can play 8k video also, battery drains when you give multiple task and play high resolution video, but it can give you atleast 3 hour battery backup. It has windows 10 Home single version upgradeable to most recent 20H2."
6762,4,Awesome project
6763,1,Buy this laptop if you want to regret your life please dont be fooled with the low price it is not worth it Please dont buy and waste your money Very very very poor performance It hangs very badly as soon as you install a software so pls dont buy and waste your money like i did Just worked well for one month then its totally gone i am unable to replace it as the return policy has expired
6764,5,the laptop is good.Build quality is also good.battery is average and nicely fast charged.performance is good
6765,5,Best product
6766,3,Battery is Just about of 1.7 hours something . Just Useless Battery ...The upper case that is the Monitor Panel is too light that....It moves like ...There is wind blowing....Very Light ...But Overall to use this...U just need to Attach Power Cable everytime...
6767,2,Worst product
6768,1,Very slow and sluggish. Intel laptops are based. Finally sold it out
6769,5,display:4/5 battery:3/5 keyboard:4.5/5 performance:4/5
6770,1,"Battery problem, low speed ,don‚Äôt waste a money"
6771,5,One of the the best product on this price range
6772,4,"It's a Budget Laptop, never expect a Gr8 performance. But a very Student required Performance"
6773,1,Waste of Money
6774,5,THE LAPTOP IS VERY GOOD AND YOU BELIEVE ME BUYER'S IF YOU ARE DECIDING TO BUY A LAPTOP WITHIN A RANGE OF 30K TO 32K YOU CAN EASILY AND WITHOUT THINKING TWICE GO FOR IT.. IT IS VERY BETTER THAN i3 8th generation THANK YOU!!
6775,4,Slow but it's ok.
6776,2,Very slow and some time it will struck
6777,3,Sound quality is poor..Battery backup is average..Anti virus free for one month only..
6778,4,Nice Laptop with good built quality and performance. But sound is very low and battery backup not impressive.
6779,1,Too much lag I can't use it daily basis waste of money I lost my money but I wanted to save your money so if your bray is in right place so don't buy it
6780,5,"1. Worth the money i spend. I have got in 24 k in big billion sale. 2. Plays 4K video flawlessly. You can imagine the processing power it has. 3. Designed beautifully, looks like it's made of metal body. 4. Adapter wire is short 5. Screen is bright enough and sharp due to 1080p resolution 6. Boot time 20 second, shutdown time 5 second. 7. Battery backup is 3 hrs with movie playing with highest brightness and full volume."
6781,2,"Very bad machine 25k ,,very hangedd +takingvtime to much ,"
6782,5,Not bad
6783,5,Price to Performance ratio is very good. Works like a charm for standard multitasking. Design is a big plus. Looks very elegant and classy. Weight balancing is also pretty good. Battery life is average 4-5 hours. Would suggest everyone to increase the ram to atleast 8GB. Better than Intel i3 7th gen that you might get in this price bracket. A great buy. Satisfied with the product.
6784,5,good one
6785,3,Fast delivery just in 31 days..... Nice product worth @. 25 k
6786,2,"Service post delivery after raising complaints was bad. Multiple follow ups and end result was nothing. Things take time to load even with a blank laptop. Screen part of the laptop has no stability, shakes a lot. You need to press hard on the mouse pad not the smoothest. If bought will need to be upgraded with better RAM."
6787,5,Superb product lenovo

6797,2,Bettery is not better
6798,1,"Laptop is dead slow I never expected ghis from Lenovo especially, why did they released such an laptop. If we want to upgrade the memory also no info provided in bios regards to speed in MHz.  To those people who want to purchase this one kindly look for Other laptops."

6812,1,"Very bad laptop, very slow, hanging problem due to dicount offer i got in low budjet but go for i3"
6813,2,I thought it's good laptop but after one day it became very slow I think I need to add more ram and SSD to it in order to use it.
6814,5,Just expect to update the ram to atleast another 4 gb.. Laptop isn't so slow as its own.. But when there's a heavy load it will lag.. You can make this a beast if you can upgrage the ram and ssd.
6815,2,Laptop accha hai but battery is not good
6816,5,It is very useful and the best laptop ever.
6817,3,Not having CD disc drive. I am surprised that laptop is not having disc drive. Hanged once with in week
6818,5,All is well
6819,2,"Laptop is light weight and stylish in design. As per product description on detail page, it comes with lifetime MS office and free one year subscription of McAfee, but in reality the MS office applications are not getting updated and applications are not working as well as the subscription is only a 20 days trial and you have to purchase separate paid subscription of McAfee. Well the delivery system of the product is horrible and got my laptop after whopping 10 days....."
6820,5,Laptop is working fine no issues of heating or hanging while working face by me. Battery backup is good and it can work upto three hours without charge. Overall fine performance.

6828,4,Good product
6829,4,Product is good.. but a very delayed service from Flipkart.. would never trust on Flipkart again for any items as commitment to customer is on least priority for them.
6830,1,"Cost to feature good deal, but quite sometime lags in performance. So overall disappointed. The windows update even can't go smoothly installed on the laptop. very pathetic / poor performance."
6831,4,Nice
6832,3,One thing is annoying in this laptop is its fan noise.
6833,4,Overall good machine for basic work.  Using aroun 8-9 hours a days.  Battery -3-4 hrs average  Display 4/5  Performance 4/5
6834,5,Amazing product at this priceüòçüòç
6835,5,Dont hesitate before buying it.. True reviews- Battery backup is low If you want to use it heavy upgrade the ram and ssd The 4gb 1 tb varient is pathetic.. But if you upgrade it you will love the performance
6836,3,its overall performance of battery is very low with in one hr the 100% battery draining out very bad performance
6837,5,"Overall product is good. Good Picture quality, Good battery and good performance by processor. But build up quality is not so strong, quality of keypad is not so good, it should be improved. Flipkart customer support is very bad, they only provide assurance, not resolution. I does not get McAfee antivirus 12 month subscription. Today 15 days are going to end of delivery but still not getting Antivirus license key."
6838,5,"Value for money, I upgraded ram to 12 and its performance changed a lot, now i can play games like gta5"
6839,3,Speaker volume is very low as of my openion rest the laptop is good for basic uses....
6840,5,Nice

6848,1,laptop is very slow in performance and it hangs while opening 2-3 tab in chrome...don't buy...
6849,1,This laptop gets heated and making too loud noise.
6850,5,Nice... For student.... At low budget... I purchased in big billion days at 25240
6851,1,Microphone not working...touchpad is loosely fitted...poor build quality...delay flipkart delivery...never buy anything from lenovo...build poorly and in huge amount so the price is so less but it will hardly last for 2 years...batter to go for Asus Vivobook 15 or any higher brands like Dell or hp...if you compromise with quality...you will regret later...spend some more money and go for other brands if you dont want your laptop last for only 1 or 2 years...
6852,3,"Non of the windows drives were up to date, had to upgrade everything and until it was upgarded, MS office wont get installed.  Lags a lot, better to get the RAM upgraded. Not for gamers or heavy users"
6853,5,Excellent product... Flipkart please make sure that the item is delivered on the committed time...
6854,4,"One of the best laptops in the market at 26k ,I think I can't get better deal at this price. But the performance of the laptop is average what we can expect in this prise range Other wise it is a complete killer"
6855,5,If you get a DDR4 2400mhz ram it will run fast as lightning and because of dual channel and 2 gb vram it runs games like GTA5 and almost all Big titles in gaming with descent fps on low settings .Check its benchmarks on youtube it runs almost all games descently.
6856,2,Very very very slow.
6857,5,Fully value for money purchase.
6858,5,Good deal
6859,4,"I got this laptop at 24240 Rs during sale time.  Design is very nice. Very slim and delicate. Display is full HD with matt finishing, but viewing angle is very poor because of TN display. I personally suggest for 14 inch display. Because in case of 15.6 inch display, screen is lightly swing/tilting with ceiling fan air. Performance is average, it justify price. Not so great. Battery backup is average, depend on usage, with internet it consume more power. Average 4 hour battery backup. But co..."

6867,3,"Battery life less than 3 hours. Display isnt upto the mark. Lenevo 30gb promotion with Dropbox offer doesnt work. Better to upgrade RAM as onboard 4 gb will not help in even basic tasks, will always lag. Not for heavy use. Ok for basic programming and studies."
6868,5,Nice product
6869,5,Best
6870,5,I am writing review after 10 days if purchase . It's good for study and professional purpose . I haven't tested it for gaming........1/11/2020..........

6889,4,"Got it for 26 k on sale,best laptop for that price with a powerful Ryzen 3 processor"
6890,3,"The performance of this laptop SUCKS, really , truly sucks.  Dont buy this laptop for any more than 25k, so you can afford a ram upgrade & probably a ssd.  The display is above average. The battery is poor. The look is great.  Performance is worse than a pentium laptop."
6891,4,In ad it was written that Microsoft Office app is preloaded whereas I find that only Microsoft 365 is loaded for one year only. Rest all is fine so far.
6892,2,Slow Laptop

6902,2,Bat
6903,4,Just bought this laptop.fully satisfied.worth every single penny.only one flaw is battery backup that is quite small.but charging is fast so no concerns. Do not purchase if you are a heavy gamer or want to do too many tasks.overall this laptop is good for students and professionals.go for it if your budget is around 25k to 27k
6904,4,"At this price point this one is very good The problem i faced is about speakers,the sound quality is very poor.better to but a sound bar or any small rated speakers"
6905,3,Good
6906,4,Great laptop for beginners. Might operate slowly due to low ram capacity. Windows 10 is also great
6907,3,"ok not so fast , speaker volume is less i dont where dolby digital has been used , no keyboard light display .very slow opening .opening three apps systems gets stuck."
6908,5,It's good... battery upto 5 hours....design super
6909,4,Everything is good except battery backup... hardly 3 to 4hrs while browsing and 2hrs when zoom call is on. Good thing is it was getting changed with in 1hr 30mins
6910,4,It is best laptop under 40000. If your budget is higher than 40000 then go for other laptops Everything is fine but yellowish didplay
6911,4,"For the price it's an amazing product. A little sluggish at times, perfect for casual usage."
6912,4,Nyc
6913,5,Awesome laptop..
6914,4,"This laptop is pretty good for the price tag it comes with. Got it for 23k in the big billion day sale. the only drawback was the 4 gb ram...these days even phones dont work well with 4 gb ram. i would suggest anyone buying this should also get additional 8 gb ram along with it to make this laptop amazing. The highlight is the design, thin bezels and display..i dont think any other company is giving these specifications in this price range. i am Pretty happy with the purchase as i bought adat..."
6915,5,I have bought it at 25k at that price it is best. Battery life i average when connected to WiFi. And sometimes it lags also.
6916,1,"Error status is shown as ""Hard Disk"" not installed. Disappointed with purchase"
6917,3,Built quality is poor
6918,4,"The RAM should be upgraded else the performance is very slow, after the upgrade it is good"
6919,5,Very good laptop of this price.
6920,4,"Laptop is awesome .. Best laptop under 30k Better go with Amd ryzen 3 instead if Intel core i3 8th gen, Laptop delivered after 8 days of book date ,it's OK bcoz purchased on big billions days , happy with this laptop"
6921,4,Wonderful laptop
6922,3,"Camera is ridiculously bad ..no clarity ..want to understand whether it's the issue with the laptop recieved or its universal with this model ... Keyboard acts funny ..they are actually interchanged so if u want @ u need to press shift and "" to get it instead of shift and 2. ..."
6923,4,"The laptop looked great however the build quality could have been better (plastic body). Got MSO student version with it and one month trial Anti virus. Battery is good but that depends how Im using my laptop. AMD ryzen is a powerful range of processors, let's see how it holds up in future. Digital Dolby sounds great. Fast charging almost takes 90min to full charge from 5%. Decent webcam. Keyboard looks great but without backlit so in dark look hard. But the design looks sweet and slim."
6924,2,After using it for a month now I can say it's too slow even in day to day tasks. I don't know with 4 gb of ram and 1 tb of hard disk how a laptop can work too slow. I also think AMD Ryzen 3 processor performance is not up to the mark it's too slow u must go with intel processors.
6925,5,"Superbb product ,ryzen 3 is better than i3"
6926,3,not bad at this price
6927,5,Nice Look and Video clearly is good

6943,5,This product is to much good and thank you flipkart
6944,5,I m Fully Satisfied üî•‚ù§
6945,3,"performance average lit bit slow , display colors not natural and camera is very poor"
6946,5,I think it is best laptop for students.you will get 4 gb ram but you have to upgrade ram to 8 gb for better performance.Otherwise you will get poor performance.battery is about 3-3.5 hours.Display is very good.
6947,5,Very very very super laptop all is good.
6948,4,If u want it for daily purpose...it's the best in the Range. And if u want to do some heavy work..I would recommend upgrade the Ram to 8Gb
6949,5,It's very nice I loved the slim body of the laptop the function the keys every thing.its excellent gud product to buy and use it nodoubt
6950,4,Good
6951,5,It's a very good laptop at the price of under 25k Only thing is that the 4GB Ram is not sufficient for this because in 4GB model it is little bit lagging...Rest all things is good specially build quality and weight...ü§©ü§©ü§©
6952,1,The laptop is completely waste of money it's getting to late to open and hanging tooo much it is not the good product ..waste of money and waste of time .we never expect this from flipkart
6953,3,Very very slow and too lagging
6954,1,Mcfee antivirus not working that was pre-installed for 1 year subscription free

6958,5,Value for money..... satisfied with the product
6959,2,Edited review.  Worst decision of my life buying this garbage. Utter waste
6960,4,"Hi,  It's been 4 months since I started using this laptop. I would like to say that it is a good beginners' device for basic functionality; no heating/hanging issues, tactile & responsive keyboard, good color saturation on the screen, charges fast and has moderate weight.  Overall, a good buy for the price."
6961,3,"Good design and light weight but performance is average because it's a budget laptop under 25k. Only for student or normal working or entertainment use, not suggest for multitasking or heavy use."
6962,4,Very nice product i love it .
6963,5,That's nice but performance will be batter after ram upgradation
6964,5,The display and build quality is damn good.Feels premium. Battery life is medium. 4.5 hours-5 hours on full charge. Processor speed is good enough. Ryzen 3 is better than i3 in terms of speed. Front camera is the only down side here.. its below average Overall it is awesome and probably best in the price range.. Theres a brand called Avita which offers higher specs like Ryzen 5 and 8gb ram in similiar price range but again its risky as its not a renowned brand and after sales service can be h...
6965,4,GOOD FOR STUDENTS AND OFFICE WORK
6966,3,"Build quality is good. Sound is very bad, lenevo should improve this. Display is ok. Battery backup is bad."
6967,3,A must buy laptop under 25k!!
6968,2,Slow perfamence
6969,5,Display screen is not that steady.Initially struggle to activate office. Overall good budget laptop
6970,1,"You cannot open 3apps simultaneously, for the same prize you can prefer avita ryzen 5 with 550gb add"
6971,1,It take ages to start .. nothing installed yet takes 20 min for bootup... Better buy some other brand
6972,3,"With 4 gb memory, we are not supposed to work on windows 10... too slow..."
6973,5,Good
6974,5,A nice handy product from Lenovo. Ryzen 3 is performing outstandingly. Sound quality is top class. Overall a fine product.
6975,4,Nice laptop with awesome build quality in this price point. Best buy if you are going to do just browsing and simple tasks on laptop.. Best value for money.
6976,2,Laptop get hanged in normal uses. Keep hanging at start and need reset of pc again and again
6977,5,Good
6978,1,Keyboard is not working
6979,5,Worth buy
6980,5,"Using this for 2.5 months now. Primarily to attend Online meetings, Online Classes, Email and working on documents. No complaints at all now. Affordable, looks good, works well. Hope the nice experience continues."
6981,1,System is very slow. It will take atleast 15 minutes to open. After that if you try to open a word document again it will take 30 mnts. Please don't go for this.
6982,3,good
6983,3,good laptop at this price but speaker quality is not good and little heat issue
6984,2,Very sluggish
6985,3,Average Performance
6986,5,Nice Product
6987,1,Very pathetic performance.it gets hanged even if you is being played.not for multitasking. HD video is also seems as a normal standard video
6988,2,"Poor performance, battery backup is too low"
6989,4,Good budget laptop. I was sluggish initially... But was good after few configuration setting changes. The viewing angle of the display isn't good. It can be used for basic office work and online learning
6990,4,"This is the best laptop you can get at this price range, works well for all basic usage, softwares like Photoshop, Movavi Video Editor, etc. also works very smooth üòä"
6991,5,Nice productüòä
6992,5,I am using this laptop from 3 months... This is the best laptop in this price range... Best for your office work...No lagging (disable start up of affecting apps) For students it is perfect to learn and attend online classes... No buffering while playing Asphalt 8...  Just Go For It...
6993,4,Product is good but due some network settings fan started running continuously for 3 days then i went to reset network settings then it has been stopped.....
6994,1,display problem within 2 months

7001,2,"The Laptop was working fine eventually however later the battery life decrease drastically & the processor slowed down, now it feels like I clicked on n icon q century back & it just loaded the page."
7002,1,Don't even think of buying this if u do that u gonna waste Ur money... It take almost 10-15 minutes even to copy and paste a 30-40 mb file and u know what is even more frustrating that u even can't do anything else while it is copying bcoz it will hang if u try to do so.... Very slow laptop ...my old laptop that I got from gov. For free was better than this....won't buy it even if someone is selling it for 5000 only
7003,3,Good
7004,1,Its the worst laptop. Don't think I am a lenovo hater . Its problems 1. Battery backup is only 1 hour after fully charged 2. Don't even think of buying it for gaming . FPS is low and the laptop hangs . Even with 1gb graphic card and 4 gb ram it sucks
7005,5,Must buy. Excellent and is all rounder
7006,5,Most perfect
7007,4,Pros: ryzen3 is good @this price range : Good display : Premium looking design Cons: build quality is not that good : Touch pad is not so responsive : Hdd

7010,5,Nice just loved it.....
7011,3,Product very good but just sometime.lag this device.
7012,2,"I am writing this review after using this product more than a month. Processor is very slow, it's even hangs up if we work on more than 3 windows at the same time. To me I doubt that the company is actually installed RYZEN 3 processor, since it's seems to be working on some really old processor. Battery backup is also not very impressive all together is not the value for money at all."
7013,2,"Hangs alot. Performance is also very slow. It was having 10days replacement, but these 10days almost take for product installation and after thay when we start to qork gradually things comes up which become hell to even qork"
7014,3,Battery backup is not good
7015,1,"It has not even been a year, and the laptop is terribly slow, mouse has stopped working and one key kept auto typing until I disabled it with external software. I called the customer care, five days back, they haven't sent the engineer yet. My experience is not good with this device since beginning. I Do not recommend this laptop."
7016,1,Takes more than 10 minutes some times to open 1 excel file. Very slow processing
7017,2,Slow. Poor battery
7018,1,Worst things ever purchase Mother board note work after 1 month..

7022,1,Very worst product Dont buy Fan sound is very high and both customer care are not responding
7023,1,Keyboard is not working after the use of 2 months...Also The Mouse Pad Is Not Working.... Attempted For Warray
7024,3,after using it for 2 months its pretty slow and worst sound quality
7025,1,"Please, fraud, defective Product, small size not order this product"
7026,2,Low audio and performance
7027,3,"This got a lot of complaints.. battery issues, fan issues.. getting switched off automatically while working. horrible buy.."
7028,4,very good product for student
7029,3,"OCT 2020- System crashed, got it fixed since under warranty. it was motherboard issue and they had to replace it. Now seriously doubt about the RYZEN processors. god knows how i am going to manage after warranty period.  September 2020 Slow system, bought for daughter online classes. Using for around 2 months now. Sometimes it freezes while in online classes."
7030,3,The Camera quality is too bad & the sound of the speaker is too low to listen. Didn't expect this type of quality from LENOVO. Do anyone has the way how to over this issue?  Picture quality is good.
7031,3,Very slow. We Need to upgrade Ram for better performance.
7032,4,If u use a wireless mouse and dont care much about battery life ... it is pretty decent notebook for the price. Suits my need absolutely fine. Have upgraded ram and installed SSD and its pretty quick.
7033,5,"This Laptop has been great so far. I got this for the MS Office offer and Windows that were free. I got this Laptop only for office use. Surprisingly, it runs games from 2012 quite well. Games like Assassin's Creed Black Flag and Batman: Arkham City run well on low settings. This is when I have not even upgraded my ram to 8gb dual channel which was recommended by many tech articles. I will get it later. Remains cool and does not heat up that much. Battery is not that good, but you can use th..."

7039,1,"System works very slow, processor not support the regular work, it works toooo slow"
7040,4,Just ok
7041,4,Value for money laptop
7042,3,"Customer support very poor... If someone willing to buy, then put the money in some other use or buy it form nearly shop.. but do not take such product from flipkart.. My money totally lost.. And also lenovo support very poor and disappointing.."
7043,1,The brand new laptop is terribly slow.. there is lag for everything and I wish I can return the product.. not worth it
7044,3,"Ordered it and received ontime. Firstly very bad camera, those who use for online meeting, full grains u can see. Battery drains fast 2hrs max u can use. First 10 days return period it was silent but after that fan started making noise too much don't know any solution to it. Overall average to little above average performance for this price range."
7045,4,good laptop but battery drains faster not satisfied with battery backup it has overall performance is good except the battery backup.

7048,2,My laptop speaker sound is turn so low. Dnt buy it.
7049,4,I feel little bit slow as hear about other person. Otherwise it is good for office work. Battery is also average not much atleast 2-3 hours giving backup. I will suggest all of u if u want to work day to day lifestyle just go for this laptop.. remember it carefully this laptop coming with plastic body..so plz use protection
7050,3,Sound speaker very worst pls design speaker in top of the laptop dont put sound speaker on down audio level very very low
7051,4,Good one
7052,5,Nice product according to budget
7053,3,Fan makes continuous noise which is irritating. Rest is just like any other laptop in this price range.
7054,4,Super
7055,3,I just think it's an average performing laptop. Maybe that's what you get for this price . ONE TIP use it on the LAP or a STAND if keep it on bed and use it for long it will over heat and start crashing until gets cool
7056,4,Fab oneüî•üî• but battery backup not so good except everything is litüî•üî•

7069,1,Very poor performance and dead slow
7070,3,Good but not the best
7071,5,Not a good battery attachment its daraining fast. On base of desing and display its a option for this budget. Overall performance can be more better i think for its not a good option for netflicks. I feel some lag when browsing and it is slow Some times

7114,5,Nice phone. Worth a money. At this price point what else can you ask for? .. Thanks Redmi.. I found some interesting features in the camera. Nice Disply and it's fast indeed. Battery life is pretty good. Overall it's decent smarty..

7117,5,"What else do one expects in this price range? Hm... Best in its segment literally, talking about cameras, battery, performance, display and everything else (including Xiaomi MiUi) bestest ever! It's my daddy's smartphone, he'd be greatly using it... I do recommend to go for it, it's just awesome. Here are some shots and a ss for authentication, yes go for it! It's just a perfect phone for everyone (here ""everyone"" means literally ""everyone"") thanks Flipkart and Redmi too!!"
7118,5,I like this phone its very interested features and battery backup is very good & nice camera & nice performance üòä
7119,4,After MIUI V12.0.7.0 update performance is good but camera is very worse in low light only because it's software is not well optimising after clicking image. During clicking photo looks good but after save it just worsen quality. Avoid for camera use as you get good photos only in very good lighting like in morning & afternoon.
7120,5,I liked this phone as much as I can praise it. and tha phone is very very good colour thanks you very much Flipkart üíùüôÉüòò

Biggest one is camera, its pretty ordinary, I will never believe in their Megapixels value, its not at all 48MP. INFACT, its barely 8MP. AI is also not so good. Front Cam is even worst, Its like a 2MP camera from some branded phone. I dont know why are they putting these many Cameras on the back  I needed a budge..."
7124,4,Awesome mobile smooth work fantastic I love this product my brother is so happy
7125,4,"Very Good Product. Everything is Good. Best part is battery which is long durable. It could be much better if having- Camera: Some features more Zoom features, require high megapixel for front camera. Procesor: Slightly lower  But interm of value for money, it is very Good Product."
7126,5,I am giving this review after 1 week just to ensure the quality properly. First talk about Flipkart it has given me the decent product no damage no issues. now about the mobile I really like the mobile the performance is very good . No damage everything is fine. Worth purchase. But there is slight heating issue while charging. Other wise it's a decent product.
7127,5,"Set is superb and the person who delivered it to me is very nice and trying to make customer valuable by his work ,he delivered it to me on time.thank you üòä"
7128,5,Nice product in the price range and battery performance is too good ...camera quality is also good and speakers are so good ....love the device üòäüòä
7129,4,"The mobile is awesome. Had ordered it for my aunt. She was previously using Nokia feature mobile. This is her first smartphone. She is able to use is easily. Pros 1 Superb Battery 2 Good Display 3 Nice Connectivity  Cons 1 Camera is below average 2 The side mounted finger print sometimes don't recognize the finger 3 Mobile feels bigger in hand 4 Charging take almost 2 hrs  But for the price range, the mobile is good."
7130,3,Review after 2months. Budget phone. In this price specification is good. Battery backup is moderate in heavy use but in ideal mode is good. Require +3hour for 0 to100%full charged. Back camera is good but as per 48Megapixel is average. Selfi camera is not good. Body is plastic fiber so is good. Design is awesome. Performance wise is ok.

7131,4,Overall good but if you are a camera lover than this is not good for you Battery is like 4000 mh And yes heating issue when you use afternoon time and also while charging it's heating I will give 7 out of 10
7132,5,At this Price range amazing and fabulous Device... I loved it but back of mobile is big Redmi Branding it is too bad. Xiaomi Please keep branding in small font.
7133,3,"Its a normal smartphone only. Don't get lured by this 48 MP camera , its of no use and on words only. Its capable of taking a normal pic only which even 5 MP cam takes. Better opt for any other smartphone with 6 GB RAM in same price."
7134,5,"Well, after a month's use, I think you'll have to go for this mobile! Great battery performance, camera is quite amazing, charges quickly, the touch is nice, overall, has a great structure :)) For this price, it is a good choice!"
7135,5,"I have ordered this for my friend and used couple of days. My opinion  FLIPKART DELIVERY WAS A DAY EARLY.  BATTERY : Was good long lasting Video's, online games didn't made much dent battery ..  Display : display looks clear & very good  Camera : Camera is very good in sunlight & 48 mp camera shot was beautiful.. but night mode not so amazing  Value for money : Yes it is 100% value for money..   Ps : i would have opted for redmi note 10"
7136,3,This phone performance is Good But It's Not the Best . Battery backup is also Good Because of The SD 662 11nm Processor.  But there is some issues with the Camera.Quality is not good as expected Front Camera Quality is very poor than REDMI 6 even it has 5MP sensor and 3 Year Old.  And Display produce good picture quality But Display is little bit yellowish and not bright compare to Other Phones.  My Conclusions is if you are looking for Camera and Display then this is not for You.
7137,5,"This phone is amazing and I love this phone like this range awesome processors, camera , display and other features. This phone is very good."
7138,5,It's a good phone at the price point but you will be slightly disappointed with front camera but considering the price point it's a good deal I am really loving the experience of the performance of the phone even the finger print sensor is also has no great delay and display is excellent Over all it's a good phone at the price
7139,5,The phone has pretty good camera and battery life. Not impressed by the performance though. But as a whole is a good deal as per my choice. Only for thise who need good camera and good battery life. Again has 1080p display which adds a bit of beauty to viewing experience. The speakers are great for the price. Happy with the purchase.
7140,5,"Excellent performance in every aspect but didn't felt the difference b/w 48m & other cameras, all click excellent pictures. The phone size is too big & you can't handle it with one hand. It's quite heavy. Looks stunning though"
7141,5,Awesome mobile redmi 9 power. It's working nicely and battery backup is Very good. Overall it's a very good item. Thanks.
7142,5,Good phone good speaker good battery life no hang very good I love it
7143,3,This Smart phone is very good phn.On gaming this is the best phn in few money..
7144,4,Good phone camera quality is good and the most important things is battery backup is very good. It will give long last 14 hours to 16 hours on full use of phone
7145,5,1. Notifications LED is not available. 2. Double tapping screen lock feature is not available from home screen. (Only screen on/off is available when screen is lock)
7146,5,"Honest review after a month  Sound quality just amazing Display is really good at such price point Battery backup cames for a complete day even at heavy usage Gaming experience not upto the mark as I found many frame drops but you can play BGMI at low settings, always keep in mind it's not an gaming device Looks and design just steal the heart, wonderful  Under such price sigment  Overall for daily usage it's really amazing device"
7147,3,"WRITING A REVIEW AFTER 2 MONTHS USAGE Camera : IT IS OKAY TYPE BATTERY:ON NORMAL USE(6-7 hrs) it lasts about 1 day DISPLAY: NO PROBLEMS TILL NOW,So Far so good VALUE FOR MONEY:ü§îWorth it definitely üëçüèª  PERFORMANCE: GOOD,  IF PERFORMANCE IS A CRITERIA For you THEN YOU CAN GO FOR 6GB VARIANT(I HAD BOUGHT 4 64)  A GOOD IF YOU ARE SEARCHING FOR YOUR PARENTS,but go for 6 GB it is better in long term usage.Happy buying!  ALSO IN AN LITTLE BUDGET YOU CAN BUY REALME NARZO 30 4G(DO CHECK IT)üëçüèª"
7148,5,Under 10k I think this is one of the most powerful phone. The camera works decently and takes clear crisp photos. It easily goes for a day with high usage and 2_3 days with minimum use. The display is large and sharp for watching videos. Performance wise it provides smooth actions.
7149,5,"Very fast delivery from Flipkart. Thanks. Redmi 9 Power has very powerful batteryüîã backup. Must buy, who want longer battery backup. Worth buy mobile in this price segment."
7150,3,I'm satisfied with this mobile..actually i am first time using mi ui I'm fan of stok android but this is pretty good worth it
7151,5,Excellent mobile in this price. Battery backup is awesome. Camera is also performing pretty good. Good buy. Value for money. Loved it. ‚ù§Ô∏è
7152,5,Best Price This year best battery back up mobile Very fast delivery flipkart Stereo speakersüîä superb Full HD screen awesome.. Totally nice.. I like it
7153,3,Nice phone in correct price.. U should also try this phone Good quality of display and battery but something is missing like front flashlight
7154,5,"Power packed performance, absolutely loved it!! Initially I had a confusion in choosing this phone. Finally i zeroed my search to samsung F11 and Redmi Power: But now I realise that my choice is right about Redmi 9 Power‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°‚ö° Thanks flipkart for one time delivery!! Battery lasts 2~3 days easily with moderate usage!! I am satisfied with my new phone, easily I will recommend my friends as well!!!! Smooth UI, Android 10, Decent Camera, Face unlock, swipe, side finger sensor, IR blaster with MI re..."
7155,4,Fiery red colour is excellent Battery backup is also very good Camera quality is best Phone was slim and light weight Value for money
7156,3,Performance is very good and battery is quickly charging and this battery is available upto 24 hours only and camera performance is not equal to 48mega pixel. If you want to good camera please don't buy this mobile. This mobile is very weight for me. Display is good.
7157,5,It's a really a good value for money the best part about this phone is its battery backup but the charger is too slow to charge the phone as its only 22watts but the phone only support 18watts but the performance wise it's good but if you play heavy games more than an hour then you might see some frame drops But after the update the problem is solved
7158,4,"Its quite good, but camera has got quite sharpness, battery is good, display is like ok, well overall gives good performance with good chipset."
7159,4,It's a good phone for normal users.  I used redmi note 4 for last 4 years but redmi 9 power is not as fast as note 4.  After taking picture in camera preview pic is blur for one second then become clear image.  Battery is really fantastic  Camera is good in daylight and low light not so good.  Sound is loud enough.  Network signal strength is not good.
7160,5,"This phone is good for this budget. Phone back camera are quite good but front camera I give 6 out of 10. The process is great but battery backup are same as like 5000 mph. So, if your are 10k I will recommend this phone‚ù§Ô∏è"
7161,5,Very nice and photo clarity super battery power good
7162,5,"It's a decent phone I'm writing this review after the 2 days of use. Everything is good. When I ordered I was slightly concerned about the big branding at the back side but after putting the case on ( which was inside the box) it looks good and the branding doesn't feel like it's there. I don't play games so can't say much about gaming experience, but in regular uses this is really smooth. No ads till now. I think it is best at this price point."
7163,5,"Nice budget phone, camera is pretty good and battery is main attraction in this phone, display is very good. Totally a good phone under this price range"
7164,5,Excellent mobile  Good camera Good design Good battery backup Overall tremendous Mobile I recommend this mobile for low budget customers Thanks flipkart for very good and fair delivery
7165,5,Good but front camera is not good but phone is best all things are suberb only front camera ..
7166,4,.It has a good battery life . .Once fully charged if you are a normal user It will easily last for 1 and half day .Display is OK. It's not having much brightness when we put it on full brightness. .Because of 18 w fast charging it charges within 2 hr 15 min Front camera is not that much good. 48 MP main camera is good .I just used it for 1 week
7167,5,Nice mobile at this price point. Surprisingly it comes with IR blaster and the mobile is water proof and also have stereo speaker. Snapdragon 662 is a decent processor with decent gaming performance. Anyway uts a nice mobile at this price.
7168,5,"It is a very good phone with good features at this price point. The camera is good for this price point, processor is also good, and battery is superb. This phone is made for the daily normal usage and not very heavy games and the phone works very smooth with normal and daily use."
7169,5,"Just awesome, mind blowing purchase. Thanks a lot flipkart for wonder offers. Special thanks to e-kart because early morning 09:05a.m delivery my lovely products. Thanks a lot.

The light from flashlight is lesser than note 5. Power of wifi receiver is very less and i find difficulty in receiving signal when i am not so close to the wifi modem. Even my 2016 model phone picks wifi signals better than redmi power.

7687,3,At this price range there are many other(mobile) option are available. Camera 48 mega pixel is just to highlight the customer. It gives the quality as 8 mega pixel. Brightness level is also very low in daylight even after it is full. Battery is Ok but to full charge it takes almost 2 hours 45 minutes.
7688,1,Please don't exchange Mobile on Flipkart they are cheat us
7689,5,Nice product Camera & battery is very good
7690,2,value for money only. if u are looking for avg phone with average speed having 4GB doesn't make any sense. performance is average. Camera quality is worst. If you are looking for a good camera then this choice would be incorrect.
7691,5,The 9 power is amazing budget mobile without compromising necessary features. Battery capacity is the most important one ( stands for 2 days for normal usage ) . UI is also good if you disable the bloatware during initial setup process. Can handle all the daily tasks for a typical user and there is no lag during usage

7727,2,"I bought it one week ago and it has already started lagging. Sometimes it gets too much heated. Battery is good. There is a privacy issue. If you want to record someone's call, the phone let him know that you are recording. So it is very much problematic. There are lot of things that can't be done in this phone.  My only advice for them who wants to buy this phone is ""don't buy it. It's not worth it."""

8625,2,Product is good. Only one major issue which is observed that it received very weak WiFi signal as compare to other smart phone. The WiFi signal fluctuates very often. VoWiFi calls also gets disconnected many times due to poor WiFi signal reception. The issue is with the model. This has been confirmed from the MI showroom. No one is going to give the replacement for this issue. :( So if you are planning to use it on WiFi maximum time then just go for other option.

12536,5,Every phone will have same features but I love Motorola because of its gestures ‚ù§Ô∏è. It hasgood battery It has decent camera It has good processing speed and smooth running Only thing is it has plastic body...
12537,3,Loved the Color Good Finish It's bulky as far as size n it's physical feel is concerned. Display is very dull Almost Stock Android makes accesability quite an easy thing Cam is great for this price point Spot Color Pic is a nice add on in camera 128 GB with 6 GB ram would have been an icing on cake Battery drains off ridiculously. Software issue looks like.. else poor optimization.. 90htz refresh is not a gimmick.. it works and helps create a good smooth experience.
12538,5,"Overall very nice phone with all the latest feature such as android 11. Three finger screen shot , recorder and etc .battery back up is very good big display compared to other phones .camera is also good. Would recommend to buy this phone because its a budget phone with all feature."
12539,4,"Phone is really good in terms of value. With Micromax In1 in market, this one is not ""real"" value for money, I think. Because the display is just 720p... Motorola could have opted 1080p over 90 hertz display. The processor is really good at snappy and does no lag. The camera indoor is pathetic. If we use the pro mode of the camera, we can get a better results even in indoors. Having said that, Camera works good in daylight. I purchased this phone for my father, and my main requirement for me ..."
12540,4,Camer performance is ok not that wow and not that bad in this budget range good performance. Battery life is also ok if use in battery saver mode battery will.work better All over good phone in range need to work but on camera and battery
12541,5,Mobile is very good and performance I gifted my sister on her birthday She is very happy thank u moto and also thank u Flipkart
12542,5,"There are options out there that can give you better value for money like Poco, but this is honestly a very good phone as well. If you have price constraints or don't want to shift to other phone brands, this is the Moto phone to get while the prices are still lower. Personally, from a week's usage, I can tell you that it is a great phone from moto. The selling point for gamers would be its 90HZ refresh rate which the G10 doesn't have, & its custom gametime mode that has some functionality. N..."
12543,4,"Well using the device for the last 3 weeks. Here is the review-  1. Rear Camera is average, auto focus is good. Macro and wide angle has no autofocus, comes with fixed focal length. It takes little time to process the photos in the background (like Gcam) which is very annoying. Front camera is the worst. Low light performance is very poor. Video quality is poor, focusing struggles. Video stabilisation is not available, you have to use Gcam for that. Don't buy if you a selfie maniac or a photo..."
12544,5,Super ... Duper camera very very Excellent handset I love Moto g30 . Low money products very happy products. I am proud of you this is a nice products.üòÉüòÉüòÉ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
12545,4,Overall a decent mobile to purchase if you are not a heavy user. Camera does a good job though it gives realistic pictures so don't expect them to be extra punchy and colorful. 90 hz refresh rate makes the use smoother. Battery lasts long enough to not bother you. And moto unique features are like cherry on the top. You can go for it without even thinking twice.
12546,3,Pros: 1. Smooth Performance And Long-Lasting Battery. 2. Stock Android Software Experience. 3. High-refresh rate display. 4. Good price for value  Cons: 1. Camera Performance Seems Pretty Average. 2. Full Plastic Body which really feels cheap in hand. 3. No 4K video recording. 4. Max display brightness is pretty weak.
12547,5,This thing has all the acquired characteristics of Moto G family except weight. Based on my experiences with Moto G3 and X Play devices this could be a bit more simpler in matters of usability. It is appreciated even though this bulky and heavier design is an R&D deviation with higher focus on Camera and Graphics. Camera is good in capturing details. NFC as well as sensors used are at par with the pricing. Live caption too works fine. Feels nothing bad for usual graphic apps but battery drain...
12548,2,Its too big & very heavy too. Have the 1st Generation Moto phone which is still working much better than this phone. that was the perfect size which fits into the pocket very nicely. Battery life is also very bad. As everyone can see the reviews the camera is also bad. the 3 finger touch screenshot capture also doesn't work many a times. sound quality also not very good. Expected a much much better product after reading the specifications. But utterly disappointed with the product. Advice is ...
12549,5,Best Product According to price in every aspect. I have trust on Moto because I was using Moto G5S Plus till now(used for 3+ years). Love the software experience Moto provides. Would love to see more options from Moto in 15-20k and 20-25k.
12550,5,One of my favourite brand... N love to see it's coming up with better features every time ... Specially needed this kind of features in budget oriented phones... Loved it..
12551,5,Device looks very promising and the performance is kind of okay. I was hoping with update they might push carrier aggregation (4G+) which really in this device. I like the 90Hz refresh rate and 20w turbocharger.
12552,3,"Camera is goodüëçüèª not osmüòÆ , battery is poor according 5000mah‚òπ , display is osmm ü§©and selfie üëåüèª, stock android is osmmü§©. Bright ness is little bit .

12554,4,"Yes, the camera is not the best, the screen could have had some fine tuning, but the fact is, this is a no nonsense phone for the average Joe. I'm happy!

12555,4,"A Budget Champ from Motorola. In first impression I've seen lots of new addition of customisation in stock android. New camera interface, UI customize tool, battery charging options, and lots more. My virdict are as follows Pros : 1. Nice 720P display 2. 5000 mah battery with 20w turbo adapter 3. 4/64 GB - 48 GB available for use 4. Qualcomm Snapdragon 662 - Adreno 610 5. Stock android with Android 11 out of the box Cons : 1.

12556,5,"To be honest, didn't have much expectation with the mid-ranger but I was amazed at how well it is suited for day-to-day work.  I just wanted a clean UI, quick and responsive phone. (I upgraded from SD435) The moto glass is lightyears better than a notification light.  Moto's little tweaks are way too awesome."
12557,4,A very good budget oriented phone. Camera is adequate for an average user . A battery which lasts almost 2 days( average use) Big in size which is good for gamers and multimedia users . Clean stock Android experience and guaranteed security updates.
12558,5,"A Great phone to gift your parents or guardians as they don't do much with the phone Camera, good features and compact phone, the Camera could have been better !!! Great battery backup upto 2days on moderate to heavy useage. Smooth Android Experience,"
12559,5,"Moto g30 is a superb phone and value for money. The clean android experience with good signal strength, thanks to 2x2 mimo technology, and call clarity. The display and features are really good. In fact I got fed up with my samsung A70S which I bought 1 year ago. So was doubting about the display because I am used to super amoled screen. But my overall experience with motog30 is completely satisfactory. Thanks to flipkart for delivering the phone in 24hrs."
12560,5,"Moto G30 is overall a budgeted smart phone. Its camera is lagging for 1-2 seconds when u click pic. Also it doesn't have a auto adjustment brightness feature. I had read in other people's comments that display is not upto the mark, but i felt display is nice and smooth. Finishing is awesome and mobile didn't feel heavy also. One can go for it rather than going in MI or realme having short life span."
12561,4,"Camera is not as expected eventhough it's not an issue, battery life is good, complete day I used whatsapp and 4g browsing it's taken only 35 percent so battery optimization is very good. And call quality is decent level. User interface is slightly difference from others, even it's hd+ display, it's better including outdoor and nice refresh rate as I am using only auto mode. Also network speed is fine .I feel if need only call and browse as professionally, this is value for money. Did not try..."
12562,5,"Best look, perfect camera with n number of options, perfect battery backup, sound is just too awesome seems like I'm playing on speakers, screen size is big, came with a back cover in the pack. Perfect option under this price range."
12563,4,"I am impressed with it's Stock android UI and features. Camra and is better than average. It can shoot like 32 MP flagship camera. Display quality is average. Camera app is little bit lagging I hope it will be improved by app updates. But MOTO can improve your some features.ie 1. Add convert in their CALCULATOR. 2. Record voice of video in SCREEN RECORDING. 3. Give app lock in SECURITY SETTING. 4. Give feature to adding other video, audio and photo in the middle of video in VIDEO EDITOR"
12564,2,Unbiased and genuine opinion. Bought it for my father but disappointed. Lenevo has degraded moto's standard a lot. Camera: Photos have a soft touch with blurred edges. The details doesn't match the standard of a lower budget phone like poco c3 too. Macro camera is useless. Could have used dual camera setup with better hardware atleast.  Display: If you use a full hd display phone as a daily driver you can easily spot the blurred adaptive icons of the app drawer. There is no necessity of a 90h...

12566,4,Using Moto for 6+ yrs. Ideal for normal users at this budget with clean UI. Same model with 6 GB RAM variant could have made this much better option to choose compare to other brands.
12567,3,"Pros: Best part is the stock android. Performance is good. Camera qualoty os also satisfactory with the price given, doesn't look truly 64MP camera though but with the price of the phone , no complaints.  Cons: Phone batyery is not so good. Charging is slow and power back is not good as well. Pocks up heat sometimes. Its bulky, did not have this expectation from moto. Screen clarity also not so great.  Expected better product from moto."

12569,5,"I love moto phones by its gestures and it's more than average tough body than other smartphones. This time I purchased moto again because of its good quality plus fast charging and no bloatware (Bloatware is commercial software that is preinstalled on a device by the manufacturer, whether it's useful or not, and tends to waste memory and resources.

12572,4,"It has 64 MP quad camera that's good it depends upon how you click picture,90 HZ frequency which is nice at this price point, 5000 mAh battery that's also nice, display size is also good, screen could have been more clear when you will see it from side picture will look black, if it would have been super amoled it would have been great experience, ram is 4 GB that is good but processors could have been little bit better, it has light sensor which will adjust your phone light according, face s..."
12573,4,Don't expect much. Camera is good in outdoor but struggle in low light. Battery is good enough for one full day. Performance is above average. It is a value for money product. Far better than '12' in similar price range.

12576,5,"One of the best budget smartphones available in the market. With the tough build quality and sleek design, this phone definitely stands out its competition. Camera is quite impressive for the price range, battery lasts for more than a day while data on, speakers are decent, performance wise- 4GB Ram and Snapdragon 662 work really well, however the display quality could have been better."
12577,3,"ROM AND RAM LESS Camera improved performance in both day and night Pictures looks more realistic Battery stays for 2and half days in battery saving mode for moderate use - calling, whatsapp, yutube songs, online search. Charger not as fast as Samsung charger."

12579,3,"I bought moto g30 and there are mainly 3 reasons not to buy it. A) 720p screen, like no one wants that.. But good enough for spare phone. B) There is no way to change SOS calling, on pressing the power button 3 times by mistake the phone will call the emergency helpline, mine does it once a day. Thanks moto. C) They have a secondary physical button which summons the Google assist, there is no way to remap it, it's totally useless. It's fine as a temporary phone or a backup phone, it can't be..."
12580,4,Value for money. Gesture feature is fun. Hey Google works like a charm. Power button position accidentally turns of phone. Display & sound are good for what you paid. Camera is ok. Charging is fast. Go for it if want all rounder under 10k
12581,5,"Nice build, Doesn't bite your pocket, battery is okay, functional side good, touch screen looks wonderful like a feather touch. More than worth for payed"
12582,5,"Camera is average...If you are not the one who is camera centric then I think it would be desirable to buy moto g30. Display is dull compared to other smartphones in this range. Battery- It is giant and nobody can beat moto with respect to battery performance. Gesture add on is a unique feature of moto which is praiseworthy. No heating issues, long battery pack up and fastness of this phone is what attracted me most. Overall a good buy."
12583,5,"Everything is working all right, camera, UI, battery , fingerprint scanner is the fastest of all. The weight is evenly distributed over the entire phone it does not feel heavy at any specific point. This photo may not be clear but the real display is best with full colors."
12584,4,"G Non nonsense, decent product for the price, good built quality, value for money & obviously the stock Android experience is always the best with the Nokia or Motorola devices...would have been even better if Motorola had launched the 6-128gb version along with this"
12585,4,"I was looking for a mobile which has Stock Android 11 and not much choices ware available. I went for G30 for stock Android , big battery and Motorola brand.

So far very happy with the mobile."

12590,5,"After a two months of use, it's totally value for money. Of course it's not a perfect gaming phone but it handles COD, BGMI etc., types of heavy games smoothly. For a multi tasking person it's a perfect budget hero. And the little touches of MOTO Experience apps gives you more satisfaction for it.  Camera: it's not a premium grade but it does fairly it's job.  Ram management is good.  Cons: Hybrid sim slot Display could be a bit better."
12591,4,"Camera and battery are good. Good charging speeds. Been using it for 3 months. camera can be made better with software upgrades (but it does the job). No bloatwares,clean UI, pure stock experience."
12592,5,The most attractive part of this phone is its battery backup..nice premium quality photos and interesting features in it..overall loved the phone and would say its too good and evry penny spent on it is worth it
12593,5,"It's really an underrated phone maybe because of its display. Overall the stock android combined with Moto mods give a clean and friendly software experience. The cameras are really good,they provide true to nature colours. One of the most interesting feature is NFC though many people don't use it but it's really great to get it in this price range. The carrier aggregation 2*2 Mimo works pretty well and I get 4g+ at my place. The battery backup is really great I am able to get 9+ hrs of scree..."

12645,2,"I'm using this mobile for last 1 month. Few drawbacks encountered: 1. Worst battery performance. Previously I was using MotoG5s+ which had almost a complete day battery power even after 3 yrs of use, but this device hardly survive for 12hrs. 2. Slow charging. Since Motorola is providing Turbocharger, but I don't know why it takes about 4 hrs to charge fully, and discharge within 7-10 hrs. 3. Camera quality. So many functions are there for camera, but they are useless if resolution and dpi is ..."

My review on this phone Camera Rear camera is 64 mp but it not more then 13 mp very poor pixel Night sensor zero % work Battery performance is good its charging is not according 20v no fast charging Sound quality is ok Display is also ok Sim and card having hybrid slot My suggestion for young generation don't buy this phone at all.

12682,4,"Go for it _________  Moto g 30 is for reguler daily usage,it's neither a heavy performence gaming set ,nor it has superb camera,sound average,battery lasts one day easily.stock android is smooth ,nice build quality (using dark pearl varient) overall it's a good phone,any reguler task thrown it performs easily.giving this review after 20 days normal usage."
12683,1,"Camera quality is okay but pics/vids occupy more space than expected as per the quality of photos.It provides no gallery of its own that's very annoying.Overall phone is less customisable. 64GB for 11k is really expensive, out of which only 48Gb is usable, it isn't Value for Money tbh."
12684,5,Very beautiful phon & good camera I like it
12685,5,Motorola is my all-time favourite Mobile brand. So the name is enough for me. This two photos captured with my Motorola one fusion+.

12689,2,1. Takes a lot of time to charge 2. in google pay app QR code scanner not working 3. Game App automatic stopped within 30-40 sec. 4. Battery charging drain fast

12703,4,Good phone for this price
12704,4,"Performance is good. Battery lasts for 30hrs for an average usage on 4g. Camera quality is average , you need to edit settings for better picture. In colour shots is working. Almost using 100+ apps on it . Touch & screen quality is best. Hybrid sim slots but am using two sims instead of MMC card. Finger print sensor is a quick. Face unlock is a bit slow. Have played games without a lag ...I have ordered dark pearl 64 gb ."
12705,4,Awesome phone.. Thanks Flipkart
12706,4,"Overall great phone. But, even the Dark Pearl color is a lot light shade. It looks more like silver under bright light."
12707,5,Fantastic phone with amazing features at reasonable price
12708,4,Good for the price. Stock android experience Camera 2/5
12709,1,Was expecting a better product considering Motorola as a brand ..  Camera is worse ... Video playing experience is bad too.  20 watt charging takes 2.5 to 3 hrs to full
12710,1,"Until now I used Moto G (Firsts Generation) for almost 7 years now and it still works like a charm.. but to upgrade I bought this new Moto G30 thinking it is going to be far better than its predecessors, but it's the worst phone ever by motorola. It has a 64MP AI quad camera which captures the worst quality pictures and it is literally slower in performance and hangs quite a lot. It overheats quickly and even though it has a 5000MAh battery it doesn't last that long. I'm very very disappointe..."
12711,5,Good Delivery Service.
12712,5,I just love everything about this phone Every thing on it it's super....!!
12713,5,Good mobile.
12714,5,"I am editing this review after 6months of usage.  At the first everything worked perfectly, but now I am facing slight lagging in camera.When I opened camera it is taking ~30 seconds to open & sometimes I have to click 4-5 times to capture photos. But quality of the photos is really good( find attached the photos)  And front camera wont have zoom option.  Apart from this everything works perfectly."
12715,1,"Hybrid slot, not good compare to other phones. Camera also not good. Hanging problem"
12716,5,Very best quality
12717,1,The camera is bad. It's tooo bad that I will never buy a motorola mobile again.
12718,1,"Very Weak, a simple fall from 1feet broke the screen and became unusable. Other cons about this useless phone is - it feels heavy. Charging is very slow(even 33w) and dis-charing is very very fast. Please don't waste your money on this stupid phone. Only good thing about the phone is its camera and stock android. And since moto is the only phone with stock android, had to purchase."
12719,5,This phone is very good
12720,5,Nice product good quality thanks to Flipkart
12721,1,Very bad battery backup... Hang problem...
12722,3,Over-all nice performance with stock android. SATISFIED ü§ó
12723,4,Best quality products
12724,5,"Does the job.  Pros: Battery. Large display. Android version.  Cons: Llittle lag while using multiple apps at a time. Camera is not up to the mark but fine for this price. Display is not HD+, for this price they can at least provide HD+ display.  Final verdict: Good mobile packed with everything for a reasonable price."
12725,5,very nice product
12726,4,"Phones overall performance is good at this price segment, but their camera performance in like 24 mega pixel .."
12727,1,Not good this phone battery is not good

12745,5,Display ok.  Camera poor. Not a good front.  Battery good.  Charging speed good.  Brightness avrage  Moto gestures ok.
12746,5,"Cemera is definitely good, display could have been full hd, but is good & battery lasts 1 day for me( uses internet a lot, especially YouTube & OTT platforms). For this price its value for money."
12747,5,For the amount‚Ä¶its a killer phone‚Ä¶if you have kids at home and need a phone for their online class and other activities‚Ä¶go for it‚Ä¶!!!
12748,5,The phone looks awesome. The stock android gives clear UI to experience. Loved the way Motorola competing against the Chinese brands.
12749,4,Overall Good phone
12750,5,This is brought for my husband and he likes it too much thank motto
12751,4,The phone is great but there are software bugs & issues which needed to be fixed by upcoming system updates by Motorola. The software cons are:- 1. Dialer slows down during incoming calls & sometimes freezes. 2. The camera needs improvement in night shots. 3. Android 11 drains battery much more than android 10 so this issue need to be solved by Google inc. 4. Google assistant button needs customisation like quick camera or quick dialer because one needs camera or dialer in emergency & not go...
12752,2,Worst build quality ever. Didn't expect this from Motorola! I've broken my display within a month. I've redmi note 9 & moto g 30. Both fell down from my hand accidentally and the irony is note 9 doesn't have any case or glass but it survived. But moto has both glass & case still the display was shattered.  It hangs a loooot. Like a looot.  Camera can be manageable by using G cam  Sound is decent in this price range.  90HZ Lags  No protection at all.  Battery backup is good.  If you are...
12753,2,"The display is not up to the mark, and the camera is not at all good."
12754,3,Better phone üëå
12755,5,"I think this is by far the best phone out there in this price range only because of its clean and near stock user interface. No bloatware, No BS. Just plain stock experience."
12756,5,This is my 6th moto phone in last 11 years. Still the same quality.
12757,5,Camera quality ok
12758,5,Overall Good phone in this price segment.
12759,5,Nice Phone but camera quality is not too good
12760,3,Camera is 64mp but its not good .clearity of camera was disappointed... Not upto the mark and picture clearity is not good. Worst camera clearity and features.
12761,5,It's really a great purchase üòåüòå
12762,3,Camera is poor First week battery performance is very low after update your battery life increases and it performs better.
12763,5,nice product
12764,1,Camera is poor... Mi13mp camera is far better than this phone  Display quality is not as expected  Overall average performance not sooo good as they described
12765,1,"Very slow, heavy and poor camera phone"
12766,4,Little bit bulky rest all is ok for my purposes
12767,4,"Color option could be better. Overall, nice product."
12768,1,Not happy with camera while using whatsapp. Kindly refund my money Not happy with Flipkart
12769,2,mobile is good but battery backup very bad whenever u charge full it's only take 6to 7 hr to down

12771,1,Don't buy this product
12772,5,Good camera
12773,5,Value for money
12774,2,"Worst Battery. Didn't even used the phone, but the battery drains like crazy. Really disappointed."
12775,3,Phone is a bit heavy also I had to pull off the screen guard as it was a printed one. I had to buy another proper screen guard.
12776,5,Super
12777,4,Battery capacity low and camera üì∑ average Nice looking attractive üòòüòòüòò
12778,3,All things are awesom But camera is 64 mp it's just number not actull 64 mp like 24 or 32 mp . And other perfomence is awesom
12779,5,"very good performance ,and ghank you flipkart"
12780,4,Very nice

12786,5,"Stock android experience , worth the money"
12787,5,Overall worth.
12788,5,Good product compared to it's price. I think this is the first device to have advanced security(Think shield) for budget device. SAMSUNG provides knox security only for premium device
12789,5,Very good mobile! When I bought this phone gpay QR code does not work now the problem is solved by Motorola updated thank you Motorola network speed is little slow may be because of processor hope this will also solve soon I love the phone 'cause the name is MOTOROLA!
12790,5,"One of the best quality mobile at reasonable price. It is definitely better than MI, VIVO, REALME & OPPO"
12791,5,Best in this range for social use If u want to play heavy games then u add more 2 to 3 k u can go for better options
12792,5,Camera performance is not as per aspectation and left all thing is perfectly fine.
12793,5,Display is very smooth battery is awesome
12794,3,Screen should have been Full HD. That's only a drag down.
12795,5,Nice mobile
12796,5,Nice product
12797,1,It was the worst camera set up and performance that I could expect from a mobile they mentioned it to be 64 mp but when compared it's own previous model of moto g5s it has worst cameras ‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è my piece of advice would be just move away from this mobile ü§ó good day

12806,2,I am not satisfied this product
12807,1,I've been using Moto phones since first Moto-G generation and I must say that all the phones have done justice to their price. But this phone is really slow and has lag which is not a trait of moto phones .The worst thing about this phone is its battery life.
12808,2,Sound quality is not good..nd camera is not performing well..
12809,1,"Camera quality and screen touch is so bad, battery backup is poor I am so disappointed from this"
12810,5,Don't trust the old negative reviews. I am using this phone for past 2 weeks it's really awesome
12811,1,Very worst product and flipkart services or camera quality and build quality is very bad
12812,5,It's really nice..the colour is classy. Value for money and even really work smoothly and the camera is good but cant even expect much in such rate...if you are still confuse I suggest you might go with it as the phone all over is awesome.

You cannot apply a theme to it but you customize apps appearance, apply colors & various text formats or styles. This is one of the average pho..."
12819,1,"Wifi connectivity is bad, continuously disconnects even after resetting the phone and network settings same problem, very unstable. Had to return and get a replacement but the replacement phone has the same problem. Guess this is a problem with this model. Don't even think of buying this phone. Motorola has lost its value. I regret getting this phone. Also don't ever trust YouTube reviews. I trusted them and now am suffering. Total waste of money."
12820,3,"Camera quality is very poor I'm using Samsung M30s @48mp which is far better than this, u can opt this mobile if camera isn't an option for you, performance wise this phone rocks.."

12832,1,Worst phone. Don't by this product. Camera is not good even it is 64MP. In browsing there is no back button at all. We need to install the Assitive touch.why we need to install? Poor quality in calls. Suddenly it will disconnect the call.
12833,1,seroius issue with upi system just go for any other alternative
12834,5,I used only Motorola mobile for last 17 years. I purchased 7-8 Moto mobiles till now. best product. camera is best. battery back up is also good. best product in this price .

12839,2,It's too heavy and big size like Power Bank think 2 times before buy
12840,1,Only camera and battery is good and all performance is not good
12841,1,Display is not 90Hz. Switch on the developer mode and there you'll find out. That's a sure lie. Camera is of low quality. Can't capture with detailing. Weight of the device is too much.
12842,1,Display worst better Don't buy this
12843,1,"Waste of money to take Motorola G30. front camera is not good , touch screen is not good.  Instead of Moto g30 take Moto g 5 plus."
12844,3,"Overall at this price, everything thing is balanced. It is better if it comes with Full HD Bulky, thick useless bezel at bottom. Slow charging, should come at at least 30W or more power charger. Given 5 star because at this price we can't compare with 20k segment. Expect timely security updates and Android update fron android.  One line for Flipkart: product reached 4 days before to nearest hub, but they deliver on last day doesn't make sense"

Preferred for students for online class purposes only...  This phone does support gaming but there are heating issues and some lags while playing Huge games such as COD....
12852,5,"Received the phone in exchange of old phone. Moto is a super phone especially for senior citizens. Durable for years.. Good buy under 12k. Smooth premium look.. Battery stands for a day in a high usage.. Average camera despite of having 64mp, but can ignore it at this price.  Checked liked and recommended."

Pros: -Stock Android -Overall Build and Quality - -Price (11k) -USB C Charging -Display 90 hz, you can watch videos more smoothly and more frames per second.  Cons: -Camera is avg at best, Disappointed with moto. 64 MP is just on paper, its quality is not that good, but then again its a 11k phone. -Extra Button for Google assistant is waste and useless. -Fast Charging problem is its Fast Draining also, thats why I am using third..."

12978,5,Great Phone for the price especially for those who want an Adfree/ bloat free experience. I bought this for my mom and I don't want to bother her with Adwares and other creepy apps.  Snapdragon 662 is snappy for everyday use and also for playing some heavy games at medium settings. The HD+ IPS display is bright with good color reproduction and brightness. 90 Hz refresh rate is an added advantage. Camera is not that great but good. The processor is capable of 4K video record...

Awesome performance without any overheating (1 hour of BGMI makes it heat slightly but not overheat) 3. Superb battery life (consumed only 3% battery on playing BGMI for 30m) 4. Fast charges from 0 to 60 in about 20m (which lasts a whole day of heavy use) 5. Motorola features and gestures are bonus  Cons: 1. Camera is decent overall with great shots in day and night light but performs...

After purchase I just loved this colour (like petrol colour combinations) Performance also good .loved the camera . Some heating issu when u charge . Whatever 20w charging is common starting heating but as .it's reach 30% device automatically decrease the heat.

13982,1,Worst phone I ever used!!! Bought this phone only because I had complete trust in Motorola. I bought this on April first weeks. Talking about it's features; * Battery - Battery is taking more than 2 hours 40 mins to completely charged and it will drain in 1 day's usage. * Camera - I think camera they are provided is just a gimmick to specify it. A 16 MP other cameras will work better than this 64 MP quad cam. * Dispay - Nothing to say. Ultra poor!üò∂  ** I can't even use my sim properly. First...

Most of the devices in the market in similar segment comes with plenty of ad filled OS and user data harvesting apps. Considering the features it provides it's enough for day to day life. This is the only device I found ad less, comparatively less data harvesting ( I recommend to use Blockada to block tracking ).  Motorola till now live up to my expectations. I am not a gamer but I need a device ..."

Fingerprint scanner is fast and face unlock is again dependant on light on your face and is slow. Phone has bit of a chin but it's not a con by any mean. As always vanilla android software experience is good. For the price it's a good deal. If you wish to take little risk same price can fetch you infinix or low-end Samsung'..."

14491,4,Overall it's a good device. Specifications are good as per its price range. My overall experience/opinion after one month of use of this mobile phone...  Pros. 1) It's not an amoled displayed mobile but touch is very smooth because of its 90hz refresh rate. 2) Build quality is good. 3) Battery performance good. For normal user battery can go upto 1.5-2days. 4) Smooth & fast performance. No heating issues. 5) Good for normal daily users. I do not play games on mobile so don't have any knowledg...

14633,2,"An Honest Review...One of the ugliest phone. The back is horrible to look at. The screen resolution even at 90Hz is pathetic. It is far from a decent HD screen. Pros- Battery backup is good. Overall phone performance in terms of processing is decent. Good if you are running on low budget phone and do not care about looks, screen resolution amd camera."

14758,1,First of all very Low battery backup and very slow charging. Very hyped and advertised product of another CHINI company. It has slow charging and Less Battery backup than my 4 Year OLD Redmi Note 4 mobile. where as I am using it Brand New Model of Moto30 g from 25.05.21 And after 1 week of modest use it gives backup of Half day and after no use it gives backup of less than 20hours.So what the use ofso caller 20watt fast charging nad 5kmAh LiOn battery.

I like Motorola in providing near stock android experience. Thanks for keeping that while most of the brands comes with lots of junk apps. I personally like moto action, and display features. Really useful. Charger is just okay. Except camera and charger It's a good choice. I will write detailed review later"
14765,3,"Just okay okay type. Sound system is not good, not loud enough!"
14766,2,Camera quality not good as expected with moto brand. Not recommended to bay this
14767,4,"Being a Motorola user for a long time, this product is good at this price segment. Battery I didn't find long staying. Camera is better than moto one series model. Overall nice mobile not a ok product."
14768,4,Good mobile but. Camera performance average Total good

14806,1,"The color quality is bad. 269 PPI is worst. When playing games, the phone is too wide which is uncomfortable. The android OS already consumed a lot of memory of 64 GB. No dedicated slot for memory card. 720 x 1600 pixels resolution for 11K? Not worth the money spent on this. Too bad. Thought about returning it but can't wait for a refund etc and instead gave it away to my sibling who uses it only for calls and Youtube."

Pros: - Screen is not bad, it does the job, you don't see pixels, its not super amoled and nor full HD, but videos look good. - Camera quality is good - Battery life is also good, it last for a full day on heavy usage. - Performance is also very good, no lag at all in daily use with tons of apps, even asphalt 8 runs smoothly. - Build quality is very good - Biggest pro, no ads or bloatware whatsoever..."
14832,4,Good

14834,4,Performance is very slow
14835,4,You can use it for normal...it can't handle games of high graphics ...so for hardcore gamer it's not the right choice..but for a user who wants a compact device you can absolutely go for this device ... display might not be full hd but it's very good.

14840,1,Worst phone
14841,1,Battery life is unsatisfied. Slow charging is also a big problem for this. after 1.5 hour charging your will get charge from 6% to 53% . This 53% charging get drain within 1.5 hour. some time touch problem is faced by me. back cover colour is worst than expected. Previously i used moto G6. Moto G6 is perfect model. From the good experience pf moto G6 i purchase moto G30. But this model is really unsatisfied. I have purchased this model due to 5000mah battery but it really unsatisfied me.

14879,1,Camera was horrible
14880,4,Good
14881,3,A good phone for old people. Because it is basically slow . Because of 90 hz refresh rate it drains battery like hell. So if you're not using this Phone for gaming purpose don't go for 90hz. 60hz is enough and battery saving as well.  Battery : It is a blot in the name of 5000mah battery. It drains power speedily even if you're not using. I don't know why.  # It's performance is quite good. It doesn't lag. But it has a weird problem of camera. It's camera takes longer to save a image which ...

15012,1,"The phone is very bad in all aspects . To start with.  1. Camera : The cameras both front and Back are very bad , blurred and low light and no clarity. They never had proper colors. other brand phones in the price range are very good 2. Poor display and bad colors. 3. No proper Battery back up  4.

Worst part is I exchanged by Moto e5 power which was working perfectly well for this piece of trashü§¶ Terrible display and new user interface. Just not comfortable using it even after 2 months. Please please please do not buy this. Humble request üôè Moto should sell their old models instead of this."

15023,5,"I purchased it for my mother. The comparison was with Narzo20A and redmi 9 prime. But, i choose this one, because it gives clean android. People said, the camera is not good, but I don't find any issues. Charging time more but it also gives good backup. My mother runs it for 2 whole days. Performance is also good. Design is good. Fingerprint sensor can be faster but it runs for parent. Overall, good value for money."
15024,5,Good product Worth for its pricing Nice camera especially night mode very helpfull Decent front camera Battery too good Display ok but if they would have given FHD + great Not for gamers Feels good for daily usage with moto gestures No Ads..

Without internet usage it took 15% of battery for 24 hours. So obviously it will come upto nearly 7 days for full charge.

17039,3,Although the stock android experience is amazing it is to be noted that the reception on the phone is very weak given the fact that other phones give much superior results with the same sim.  A big flaw since that's the prime goal of a cell phone.

It's fast, bloatware free and you can do little bit of gaming with low to medium settings. Battery backup is excellent more than 2 days but charging could have been better. I got a good deal with exchanging a old mobile phone. So I'm happy with this purchase. Not recommended for hardcore gamers or camera lovers, a big NO."

17916,5,With Moto E7 plus you will get the Value for money and a strong belief of Motorola as there has been no complaints on Moto devices since I had one for my mother before this so I opt for Moto again without thinking of anything for her this time.

But still moto not updated in these type of common features ..need to update these feature. - When taking photos capturing is too slow...this problem is occurred smart phone initial releases .....

18415,4,"Best budget phone, but face unlock is not good. Every morning it shows to unlock the phone through pin, pattern, password"
18416,3,Moto's credibility for its build quality is degraded with this device as it's screen cracked at top right corner and with few week of usage there is lots of scratches visible without protection screen. Battery life is also quite poor even with 5000mah battery. Screen display is usable and device performance and camera is good considering the price segment.

18460,4,It's nice for parents because of stock android experience
18461,5,Very good
18462,2,"Before this model, I was used moto e4 plus and camera of that model is only 13MP and this is 48MP. Quality of camera is not this much satisfied. 13MP of e4 plus is much more good from this one. Same for battery backup. In both mobile battery is 5000 MAH. But backup in very much good in e4 plus. My suggestion is, if you are planning for buy this one than I recommend you should go with moto e4 plus not with e7 plus."
18463,3,Not good but ok
18464,4,"Good phone, everything is good, camera is not good as it told 48 mpxl"
18465,5,Product is good
18466,5,Supper phone in features and look as well as budget. I suggest to person who want to puchase below 10 thousand. Please no need to search any other phone

18507,4,Happy with this phone. 1 star is deducted for camera and display. Display is very dull..
18508,5,"Purchased the Moto G9 and Moto E7 plus in Big Billion Day. Moto E7 plus has many cost cuttings - micro USB charge point, No Fast Charging support. No case in Box, No Secondary Microphone But it Takes better photos than the MOTO G9!!! It blows my mind. Compared Well lit and Low lit Photos. In Moto E7 plus, I just have to take a single shot and can expect the photos to look good whereas there is focusing issues in the G9."

18546,4,Nice but Not Very Nice
18547,1,Received today...Ok as of now will review after a week usage Everyday I am hating this mobile after 2 weeks Iam done..such waste from motorola... Go for realme...my old realme 3i gives better picture quality than this mobile.. I bought realme 3i again after using this Camera was utter flop... Worst 48 MP ever.. output is 12 MP.. even if ...it is worst.. it says 4gb ram but hardly performs like 3 or 2 gb only dont buy for camera/ram.. buy for clean android that at 6k range ....
18548,4,Very good product
18549,5,"Awesome mobile and good looking this mobile value of many, good delivery thanks to Flipkart"
18550,3,Graphics is not upto the mark. Camera is ok and little above average even 48MP also.Having trouble in data connectivity.even though it is having higher band configuration.touch sensitivity is not satisfied. Felt little slow .  Battery and sound in good for this price. Have to accept the fact it is a low budget mobile. Even though the configuration and performance not met as they mentioned.7k is ok price for this one
18551,5,Overall superb mobile at this price
18552,4,Camera will disappoint you.. images are soft and not sharp for both rear and selfie cam.. night vision is also okayish.. 48 MP is only for attracting the customers to buy it
18553,3,Product is good but delivery was late
18554,1,Bad camera of back side..it has mirrarcast problem in all phones..I think some of money will west to invest.. My suggestion is don't to buy did product

18557,4,Good budget phone
18558,4,Nice but camera quality is not good .anyway thank you Flipkart .

18568,1,Just average
18569,5,Nice product. All are good
18570,5,"Excellent, price worthy"
18571,5,Best phone ever with no junk under 10k with new Snapdragon 460 processor and solid body.
18572,5,Nice model for mid range users...
18573,5,Better
18574,1,Camera is cheap
18575,4,Front camera quality was not that much good quality.. Over all ok for the money.
18576,4,Everything is good under this price range except for the USB type B port. It does NOT have USB type C. And doesn't have turbocharger included. Has a basic charger.
18577,4,"Overall good phone for it's price range, Motorola is trustworthy brand , and more importantly this phone is made in India, that is biggest plus point. It may show little glitches sometimes. I also needed to change that gesture navigation feature, it makes phone painful to use, You can change to three button navigation from settings. To add back button go to settings>system> gestures>system navigation>3 button navigation. It will solve your problem."
18578,5,Nice phone
18579,5,I am happy

18589,5,"Nice phone, I got at Rs 8176/-"
18590,4,Good
18591,5,Nice ...... Awesome........ Lovely product . Value of money .
18592,5,Very good at price 8099 rupees
18593,5,EXCELLENT
18594,5,Phone is so cool and amazing looking and camera design lika a iphone series And value of money is osm Battery too good And camera not bad rear osmm and front camera night time photo is bad click but go to the out of home in sunshine then you feel like a pro phone Overall gud phone üëçüëå
18595,1,"Don't buy this phone, in this phone brightness is very low quality, front camera is very poor. Battery backup is also of poor quality."
18596,5,Ok Ok
18597,5,Nice phone...
18598,5,Well I have been using this phone for quite a time now and i can tell that it is the best non-chinese smartphone in its range .The battery backup is working incredibly and till now the 10W charging is also not much of a trouble haven't tried 0-100 but it did charge the phone from 47 to 89 in 22 minutes which is finely appropriate.The performance is incredible but it does take some mere seconds for loading the apps after you restart the phone but again watching the price range its fine.Talking...
18599,1,I hate network speed this phone give some updates
18600,5,Good products üëç
18601,5,"Super, Value for money.."
18602,5,Most mind choice mobile
18603,5,Stock android no bloatwares and a decent camera. All in all a good buy.
18604,5,Great product for this price tag!
18605,4,Good in price
18606,5,Budget king
18607,4,"Camera Quality is not so good, I'm using Moto One Power currently with 16MP rear camera but Moto One Power camera is too good in comparison to 48MP of MOTO E7 PLUS."
18608,5,"So I brought this one in Big Billion Day sale and: PROS: 1. Smooth texture experience. 2. Playing media quality is great. 3. Calling quality is good too. CONS: 1. Battery backup quality has started deteriorating in just a few days. 2. Forget heavy gaming, cannot even handle moving big files or any other heavy RAM use activity. 3. Camera quality is too poor for a 48 MP camera. 4. Allows only 2 sims (without SD card) or a sim and a sd card. Doesn't have 3 slots for idk what reason."
18609,5,Awesome product
18610,2,do not buy completely waste this product
18611,5,Just awesome
18612,4,It is amazing mobile
18613,5,Nice but company should provide earphones also
18614,4,Alike professional
18615,5,Look wise very smart phone i give 5 star
18616,4,"Everything is good at affordable price. Two drawbacks as per my observation. 1. We can't able to insert 2 sims and memory card at a time, either we can use 1 sim and 1 memory card or 2 sims only. 2. In setting there is short cut option for mobile data changeover and all. Next SMS can be sent only with a single sim, if we need choose sending sms it need to he modified in setting only. 3. Screen looking dull but there is no strain for eyes, comfort feel is there."
18617,5,It's a perfect product for elderly use. It can't be used for heavy usage but it's perfect for daily use considering the usage and price it's probably a good option. If you need it for basic use and not for gaming and all go for it but it can't handle heavy usage.
18618,5,Good mobile

18724,4,Superb rear camera quality under 10k Display is very impressive and all are also Good
18725,5,At this budget the phone specification is simply owesone and performs to the statistician
18726,3,Phone looking super but processing slow
18727,2,Very bad camera quality... Even Not have 13mp camera. It's showing 48mp..but .we didn't get as much quality. We get only 13or 8mp quality.
18728,5,Superbb
18729,4,Motorola is always best

18733,1,"Battery is not good. If using the net, the battery backup is 12 to 15 hrs. Battery charging takes 7 to 8 hours, very slow charging speed. My Moto G4 Play was better than this, it used to charge fast."
18734,4,Nice product
18735,5,Battery and performance is good . it's a most value for money rather than other brands .I like the stock android
18736,3,"No fast charging option. No back case provided in the package, poor package. Phone seems to be good at this price. If possible will try to write a review after few days of usage.."

18740,3,"Camera is crap. Display is also bad. Good things are like bloatware free almost stock Android experience, big battery with 64 GB storage. It's not a value for money product compared to other offerings at this price point. Mi & Realme can offer more value. You can go for this phone only if you're a stock Android fan & you don't wanna use custom UI."

18747,3,I think if you don't want hesitate buying Chinese phone you have better options . Not gonna lie screen looks so dull and camera is just for name sake 48 mp result are worst. Build quality looks good and stock android are only pro.

18755,5,Nice phone ..have all the quality and features within this price range Go for it if you wanna buy new phone
18756,4,Display is good but camera and phone body quality could have been better. It‚Äôs too big. Instead of focusing on length they could‚Äôve improved body quality otherwise it‚Äôs worth the money.
18757,5,terrific phone

19348,1,"Well firstly, battery backup is good but places were this product failed are as follows: Microphone isn't that good at all. And stopped working after 2 weeks Doesn't sit on the collar properly. Even when the volume is full, you won't feel the bass."
19349,5,Nice
19350,3,I don't like the sound quality . I expected much more than this from mivi but i don't feel bass also and the volume is also not good. It should be upto a level but unfortunately it wasn't. The magnet is also not good. That's why i am returning this product

19355,5,Super made in India
19356,1,Flikart Service & products are bad. Think again before you buy the product
19357,2,"Waste of money, given 2 star because it's Indian company and product. Battery backup is almost nil. Connects and disconnects automatically. Very much irritating during calls. Not comfortable for every day use. Company should not have compromised on quality because of few hundreds"
19358,5,Sound is gud and bass is excellent and. Betry backup so gud.
19359,5,I have used it from the day i haven't found any glitch in this neckband. Honestly its sound quality very clear and bass quality is super awesome. Also it gets charge in 40 mins when i connect it with my 18watt charger adapter and have good playtime last survive upto 8 to 9 hours on single charge
19360,1,Please don't buy this product.this product is very bad
19361,4,One of the best neckband you can buy for under 1000 Advantages -One of the best battery backup for a neckband -Good sound quality for the price -Build quality is also good -Descent bass -Seamless connection -Worth it  Disadvantage -A bit loose(maybe just for me)   Worth the money

22363,4,"Material quality isn't that good, it is delicate. Sound and bass is loud but not very clear. Sound and build quality could have been better. If you want to buy an earphone strictly in the budget of 150rs, then you can go for it. It will be like your backup earphone. Otherwise atleast add 50rs in your budget and you can have better earphone like of zebronics."

23254,3,I purchased them in november 2020 and they died in March 2021. So unless you aren't desperately in need of ear phones invest in better ones.  Sound quality : clear & good Wire length : too short Ear plugs quality: worst (scratchy in a way) (so I added different one to them) Life : shorter than you want. Cost: cheap and agreeable  I chose it cause was needing one and this was affordable and cheap. You choose wisely.

23472,2,Till one month it worked osm but after that not working properly but sound is ok cables are loose connection
23473,5,Great
23474,1,Bad earphones
23475,1,Worst quality
23476,4,"I got it for Rs.171/- and at this price the product is at its best. nice sound and very light weight. it claims extra bass but it also depends on your mobile and the music app you are using. It also matters the bass or equalizer setting of the app. so, it's a nice product and if it lasts for even six months, I would be happy because how much you can expect when you spend just Rs.171/-? ...and after five months, one speaker has stopped working."
23477,5,Nice product
23478,5,Better sound in low price

25277,5,"Camera better,songs better,blutooth some stacks I am some quality appcet"
25278,1,"Worst! Sim holder is broken, later only I found that, sound quality not good, worst"
25279,3,It is a good product but its touch is not good.
25280,5,Ok
25281,5,My son love this watch he is very happy thank Flipkart
25282,2,Good
25283,1,This is the worst product not any sensor in this. Battery backup is only for 1hrs Heating problem .BT notification app is not so good Very bad this watch. :(
25284,1,Poor quality
25285,4,Not bad
25286,1,"No notifications no censor poor battery back up only 3 hrs No refund Dont buy this watch , Buy on u r own risk , Flipkart loot raha hai"
25287,3,"Overall the look and the features are good, however I would like to highlight a few issues that I am facing.  The notifications do not appear, calls sometimes appear sometimes they don't, on the other hand inspite of linking the notifications for the msgs, the same is not working.  Battery backup is decent enough to sustain for three full days. The maps don't work properly, there is a lot of dependency on a good internet connection, but to what I understand the watch is connected with Blueto..."
25288,5,"Looks sleek, very comfortable to wear and yet to test it out for accuracy during walking or cycling my two main exercises but I feel it's a purchase which will be very satisfactory.  After using the watch for a while I can assure you its a brilliant product and has very good accuracy when it comes to covering step counts, calories burnt as well as heart rate. Sleep tracking is very good too and the fitbit app is excellent."
25289,5,I wasn't a great fan of activity monitors but the one thing that interested me to go for fitbit versa is i can load lots of songs and can go for my daily jogging with out needing to carry my phone. I connect my wireless ear buds with out any hassle. I'm not a fitness freak but once I got used to the activity monitor the data is helping me to be more active in the day. the fun part for me is to try hundreds of different free watch faces that suit to your taste. does everything that's mentione...
25290,5,"fitbit versa is looking absolutely great !!! No doubt at all.All features are good but payments were not supported for Indian version, hoping to get payment option soon. Best product at its cost range."
25291,4,Great product for the amount paid. Got it for 7999. Its amazing and works very well. It can even measure oxygen level. Thank you for such an amazing product.
25292,5,watch is really good....i found very useful to track my activity....quality and built great for this price point...suggest to buy the watch below 15k whenever there is any offer....because then the value for money could be felt satisfactory
25293,5,Excellent product. Worth buying it. I personally suggest not to go for higher version for beginners who are planning to buy a smart watch. Apart from other cheap brands and entry level smart watches Fitbit Special Edition is best in looks and performance as well.
25294,4,"Overall a good product as it looks and feels good on my wrist.  Pros 1. Looks good and stylish 2. Has plenty of apps that can be downloaded using the mobile app 3. Vibration with notification is very strong  Cons 1. Syncing with the app takes a while sometimes 2. I was not able to transfer music to the built in music app even when the watch was connected to a wifi 3. Even riding a scooter counts as steps, which is ridiculous"
25295,4,"Great value at this price point, though I was expecting little more battery power along with few basic features like spo2, stress meter etc which are missing.  The music section required a paid version of Spotify and again the watch won't itself play. Ut you would need to carry your phone along with watch with paid version of Spotify to just manage the control. I personally don't find this useful because if I have to carry the phone than I can mange the control from my phone of bluetooth ear..."
25296,5,I ordered the peach color watch and it looks great the watch is rose gold and strap is peach colored. looks great on wrist and has good features.. setting up and configuring was smooth. Till now no issues per se. Delivery was fast and without glitch. Product was also defect free.
25297,3,not worth for money... couldn't able to get music /songs as specified.. no synch established for whattups.. calendar after all attempts post spending good time.. not worth to buy...
25298,4,"i am using this watch more than one month watch is good really helpful for those who are health consious . watch is looking perfect , heart rate sensor is also fine , tracking is also gud but one thing i feel about this is its screen .it is so small we are habitual of large screen and this watch has little screen u think fitbit should work on this ..and it straps and screen gurads also so expensive"
25299,4,I would have liked to give a 3.5 stars but there's no option here! okay so now the watch:- The watch is grt in terms of fitness related features like tracking and stuff!! my main use of the watch was to use it like an smartwatch. it works like half smartwatch at the most that i can say! Though it has great features the main problem that i faced was while connecting it to my phone (honor play) it frequently drops the Bluetooth connection every now and then!
25300,5,very beautiful smart watch.. and works perfectly..... this is my third Fitbit in family and from last 5 years we have been a part of Fitbit family..... no complain....I don't see the point of wasting so much money on apple watch when the same work is done and beside you won't need a apple cellphone to sync it is compatible with any operating system...... value for money..... only first syncing one feel takes 5 min rest it just glided
25301,4,"This is a very good watch I am giving this review after using it for one week, it looks nice display is good data I felt the data is pretty accurate. I got it during the sale and the price which I got it was worth taking it, however I was not sure that this watch is not compatible with all the devices. Before buying this watch I would recommend that you go to the website of fit bit and find the list of compatible device for Versa and then only buy it. No wonder thatYou may have to buy a phone..."
25302,5,I will divide this in pros and cons. Pros : 1. Screen brighten is good. 2. All the values shown by watch is appropriate. 3. Extra straps were good. 4 . Overall give you feeling of very premium watch. 5. I got it for 7500 so price is excellent. Cons: 1. Battery backup is not that much good (3 days).
25303,4,"Surprised to get delivery from Flipkart within 2 days. Thanks Flipkart.. Really a good quality product from fitbit with accuracy in each function. Easy to operate OS, Crisp and clean display along more functions for a fitness lover makes this product a worth buy."
25304,1,PLZZ read this before Wasting your money. PLZZ read this complete information before buying from Flipkart. They are not ready for return process even if your product is worst. Flipkart is worst in providing services so if you have any option to buy headache and problems then go there. Don't waste your time with Flipkart  Regarding Fitbit Versa Performance is very worst. Which is atomatically disconnected from the app and then act as a simple digital watch. Flipkart customer care to take thi...
25305,5,"My wife wanted a smart watch which could guess the hours of deep sleep and also count her exercise minutes, she does different HIIT forms. I was a bit skeptical before buying it but she ABSOLUTELY loved it. This was an anniversary gift and i still hear of it."
25306,4,Every day I am falling in love with this versa... only concern is battery it doesn‚Äôt lasts more than 3 days.
25307,4,wonderful product
25308,3,Used it for 4 days now its time to tell the pros n cons.Step counter is absolute fail. I had to ride 23km to work and it counted 2300 steps along with stats of climbing 29 floors which was hilarous. heart sensor works good. vibration is adeqaute to notify calls ans other notifications. dial size is too small those who are big guns consider trying it out on retail shops before buying it.. Wallet app doesnt seems to be availabe in India so NFC payment feature you can forget it. The app sto...
25309,5,awesome.
25310,1,Just don't waste your money on this idiotic product..it will make your life hell cos it will stop notifying you time and again..and only option to resolve it is reinstalling the app..you will end up doing it 3-4 times a day..bad just bad.
25311,1,I had ordered 2 watches but returned both of them. This watch is good but FitBit android application is very bad no proper syncing and had a lots of problems with notifications. If someone is purchasing smartwatch then without notification and proper syncing its just a digital watch why will someone waste so much money on a stupid digital watch.
25312,4,Worth the price... does all it claims to do...and does it well
25313,5,good
25314,5,"Yes, it is the best fitness tracker watch. Data is accurate. Yes GPS is missed, but you can carry your cell phone along while running or jogging. The tracker and App does get the job done. Display as they say is amazing, no matter how sunny is the light outside, you can view your info. People who want to track their fitness goal, I would suggest go for it."
25315,1,FitBit Stopped Working after 6 months of use. Doesnt connect to IOS or Android. Tried everything. Wasted all my investment on this watch!!
25316,4,Nice product nice batter life colour quality is very poor but Look's primium....
25317,3,steps are not accurate ..may be you have to half fold the count
25318,5,Wow great one i loved it totally
25319,4,The fitbit is good. A price around 6k would be better for this I think. although I do not think spo2 sensor is there in the device. The description is wrong.  Not a right practice to advertise something which is not there in the product. Should be changed or fix the product.
25320,5,Good to go watch . Quite light Weight
25321,5,"It is indeed an amazing fitness watch considering the price and all the features offered with it. And the extra straps are really useful, I had to buy aftermarket straps for my blaze after 2 years of use, but with the versa SE you will get total 3pare of strap including the one allready installed. And decent delivery by flipkart."
25322,4,Great watch to wear üëå
25323,4,1. U can listen to music through your Bluetooth headset 2. Takes approximately 30min to setup on wifi 3. Connect same wifi with phone and watch 4. For music upload in watch u have to download app in your laptop and select transfer music option in watch and wait to connect .Then just simply drag and drop songs and sync with watch 5. U have to take ur mobile while running because it has connected gps 6. U cant connect ur Bluetooth headset and watch together in Vivo z1pro 7. U have to on ur m...
25324,2,"Received duplicate straps (Belt) within 6 to 8 month both belts cut down automatically..... Watch is good, belt cost is 3k...."
25325,5,Loved it
25326,1,"BPM feature is not working, wifi is not getting connected, notification feature fails"
25327,1,they gave used product
25328,4,it's good.
25329,5,nice smartwatch..
25330,4,"Got it for 10,999 rs. Major problem with this is ""notification"" it never showed notification on my oneplus 6 phone. Highly disappointed!! rest everything is fine"
25331,1,"Changing opinion from 4 star to 1 star. After using it for one year, it stopped counting step, heartbeat & motion sensor stopped working, contacted it's CC they told me to factory reset it & again do setup, after doing the same for 10 time no change occurred, now watch is not starting & charging, after contacting they told me that your warranty is over & they suggest me to buy a new one, never expected such poor quality from world famous fitbit."
25332,1,"First it's not functioning properly. To be particular, i don't get notifications on phone properly. Two when I compare them with the watch which my friend purchased in US. It looks like replica. There is been alot of variance in quality."
25333,1,"the Bluetooth is very poor, synchronization gets disconnected very frequently, step count is also inccurate, app is very confusing, waisted my money, this is my last purchase from Fitbit"
25334,4,Good Product
25335,3,Amazing product but prize is very high. Coming to performance is above average Overall product is good ‚ò∫Ô∏è
25336,5,Nice product
25337,3,The connected phone notifications rarely work on this watch. Cannot see the messages nor the incoming calls. I have seen similar issue with charge 2. Tried every possible troubleshooting option suggested but couldn't resolve it.
25338,3,Writing this review after using the product for 9 months . The watch used to work almost satisfactorily for most of the period but there was some noticeable glitch in tracking the heart rate on many occasions . After 09 months it's recording of heart rate became completely erratic . It is abnormally high even during sleep . This error has made the watch completely useless as all the vital stats and features are dependent on accurate tracking of heart rate only .
25339,5,"The Versa 1st Generation is still a great bet for those wanting in on the Fitbit ecosystem. It's a no - gimmicks, no - frills smartwatch that does the job well. I got it at a great price during the Flipkart sale."
25340,1,Not supporting for Notifications.
25341,4,Device looks and feels good. It functions well.  But...  Does not pair well with MI A3 device. Please make sure that you check their website for the list of phones that it can sync up well.
25342,2,Good product without any questions. Free apps are available up to date.
25343,4,Really liked this watch ‚ò∫Ô∏è
25344,4,nice watch but have issues with bluetooth connectivity. but still overall one can have it as a beginner.
25345,1,very pathetic watch only after two weeks of use its now showing blank screen and above all no service centre in India
25346,3,first check your mobile compatibility before purchasing one..Redmi not 5 Pro not compatible
25347,4,Happy to buy it in billion sale
25348,1,not support all mobile model
25349,1,Do not buy...not worth and they fool us saying no refund..warning in 1week watch glass will break if it thouch any wall or drop..for this cost and brand they should have improved the quality and more functions. so please don't buy and get fooled
25350,5,Awesome Smart Watch At This Budgets 4 Day's Battery Backup Thankyou Filpkart..!
25351,2,Don't ever buy fitbit watch'. If anything happens after one year they will say that as it is out of warranty so nothing can be done. You may buy if you can invest such a huge amount for one year. My watch is not getting connected with any mobile phone means i thing bluetooth is not working. Its better to buy some other watch which is not so costly. On help they says nothing can be done as it is not getting connected.
25352,4,this fitbit versa is awesome... i am using this snartwatch from last 15 days and I loved it... all functions are very good and accurate... only problem I had in the beginning while connecting with phone but now it is part of my daily routine...
25353,5,Got it at an amazing deal for 7.5k during big billion days. Thank you Flipkart.
25354,5,"Awesome product, fully satisfied..great product team fitbit.üëåüôè"
25355,5,It's a good watch.
25356,2,Very inaccurate and unreliable
25357,5,Good product value for money
25358,5,Full features for this cost is value for money
25359,2,Not good start problem ha
25360,5,Value for money. Good product
25361,4,Ok
25362,3,"The activity tracking is good. But the watch's battery is terrible and barely lasts 2 days. Also, the mechanism to remove and attach the straps is the worst."
25363,1,Battery melted in 2 month time and not getting any support from any where.. flipkart customer support is just waste.. they promise to call in some time but never turned up.. facing issue from 1 month but no prevail. Dont purchase any item like that frm flipkart.
25364,5,Just premium awesome
25365,1,Worst quality of Band...... And accessories not available in local market..... I waste my money after 1 month of use..
25366,3,Battery is draining fast
25367,5,Very good. No compromise on Fitbit quality. Good deal.
25368,3,Its not worth buying this watch...you will find wtches in 2-3k which does better job than this
25369,4,Value for money
25370,2,The quality of Fitbit Versa is not good and I am writing this after using the watch for 1.5 years of limited use.  1. The rubber wrist straps are of poor quality: Cracked after 3 months of usage.  2. Vibration stopped working after 1 year.  3. The accuracy is not that good. My phone's health app is much accurate than this watch.  4. Touch (screen) not very smooth
25371,4,I gifted this to my father on his birthday. He loved it. Its really good.
25372,5,The watch looks good. The connectivity is also pretty good. The designs looks cool too. The only down fall I noticed is that it tracks your step while you are riding bike aur driving car.
25373,3,Just okay
25374,5,Excellent watch.
25375,5,Amazing Amazing Amazing product But battery backup average
25376,3,Some functions not there in actual but was mentioned on product page. The charger seems to be old with whitish texture on top.
25377,2,Connectivity is very loose
25378,5,Good product
25379,1,Most useless product. Will never get connected to bluetooth. Pure waste of money. That's why flipcart is selling it with such discount. Just don't waste your money. Super useless watch
25380,5,Good product... resonable price...
25381,5,"Cool looks and good for technosavvy people!! Keeps records of heart rate, steps and many more, has bluetooth accessibility to all ur apps in the phone üìû. Displays all notifications and calls!!"
25382,1,"Once u lock ur device , and simultaneously unpair your device from mobile then u can never unlock that device for life time"
25383,5,Excellent Fitbit for the price If you are looking for your first smart watch it a best choice Battery lasts more than 3 days Display is great Accuracy is near to perfect My experience first update is done by calling customer care which is also in Fitbit app which Is of great easy I like the most is we can add our photos as watch face with all info such as time heart rate etc
25384,3,The display glass of the watch is not worth the money. I have been using various watches all through my life. Right from HMT to Fossil. But this is the first time I bought a watch that chipped at the edges with just a light tap against the door frame. I have now worn a silicon screen protector. Also the strap broke in two months. One good fact is I got 4straps with this watch. Will never buy Fitbit watches again. Plain health bands are good but not watches .
25385,1,Very bad product. Don't buy it.
25386,2,I can not fix silicone black strap to the dail. Their is no notifications on watch and i am facing problems because of this
25387,5,"A gr8 watch with best discounts from Flipkart and fast delivery. Fitbit is the most reputed name in smart watches with accurate heart rate, sleep & spo2 tracker."
25388,5,Very nice
25389,5,This watch was Awesome
25390,5,Truly outstanding except the battery. The looks is superb.
25391,2,Don't buy this product none of the feature is not working in this product and waste of money
25392,5,Worth buying it
25393,5,It is a good product in this price range.
25394,3,Facing issue with connectivity and notifications access on mobile.
25395,1,"The Fitbit is not getting charged at all since last 2 days. Earlier on 25th April also same issue was faced, when we kept it on the charger for few hours and after few hours it started charging. But since last 2 days it not getting charged at all. We tried various options like putting the usb charger in laptop and differ power points but no avail. The quality of the product sent is really questionable. Poor quality product has been sent by dealer."
25396,1,"Worst product to buy, waste of money. after all the attempt to fix the sync issue it failed to do so. Bought an expensive new phone just to be compatible but still facing the same issue."
25397,1,Pathetic smartwatch. Displays wrong distances. Too much error in all features. Don't buy. Waste of money
25398,5,It's an amazing product
25399,2,"The Fitbit distance calculation is wrong. Eg:: when I walk a particular distance it shows 1 km, but when you run the same distance it shows 1.4km meters."
25400,3,"The major con is the battery life. If I just wear this the entire day without syncing with phone, even then I need to charge it once in 2 days. The claim of 4 days battery life is total sham. Deducting 2 points for that alone. My older GoQii used to give me a good week's life.  The 2nd major pain in the neck was adding music to the watch. It took a software update for me to realise that I wasn't doing anything wrong, it was a glitch in existing software.  It does a pretty decent job of tracki..."
25401,2,With heartbeat on battery backup is 1+ days Spo2 doesn't work Steps count is not accurate.
25402,2,Poor battery backup
25403,5,Best watch
25404,5,This watch is so good.And I can where it anywhere.
25405,4,Awesome üòé thank you flipkart for service
25406,5,Worth buy and accurate
25407,5,"Except the average battery life of 3-4 days max... It's awesome. Transferring of songs is bit of a hassle as one can only do it thru laptop. Light weight, touch control responsive. Got it for 7999/-. Worth every penny."
25408,2,Bettery keep charging every day
25409,2,After one year display automatically damaged
25410,5,Excellent product... Useful features for a lay person to collect data
25411,1,Worst product no recommended
25412,4,Good watch...looks stylish...
25413,5,Beautiful watch...value for money.
25414,5,Used for about a week now and completely satisfied. Great look and good battery life.
25415,5,Good one
25416,1,"At this price , I could have purchased better product , worst UI"
25417,3,Okay product
25418,5,Thanks flipkart for ontime delivery. Product recieved as described in description. Will write a review after three months if use.
25419,1,The watch stopped working as on March 1st 2021. Never expected this in less than 1.5 years from date of purchase.  Not sure if Flipkart is selling low quality products or the watch itself has an issue.  Either way very disappointed
25420,5,Awsome experience....
25421,5,Good watch
25422,4,"Great smart watch. cool looks. battery life is okay-ish, around 3 days. would love to see SPO2 sensor getting used beyond just sleep data."
25423,1,Unable to reach customer care. The product is not even used for a week now the battery is getting drained in less than 12 hours.
25424,2,Not good
25425,1,Waste of buying
25426,5,Nice watch
25427,5,Very nice product...üëç
25428,4,All good on the accuracy front. Battery life could have been better though .
25429,3,Item is ok bt not supported some apps
25430,1,"Persistent sync issues, pl don't buy"
25431,4,Its a good smart watch with all the necessary features. Highly Recommended
25432,1,Absolutely inaccurate in terms of distance. GPS connection is horrible. If you are looking for sports tracking then better choose Garmin or other chinese brands. Not satisfied with Fitbit's purchase. Wont recommend
25433,1,Very bad experience Connectivity is zero backup also poor
25434,5,Very nice smartwatch in low price!!!
25435,5,"Works great, got delivered on time. Step counter was inaccurate for a bit but nothing you can't fix. The battery lasts for 3-4 days on constant use without notifications. If you have notifications on then it will drain faster. You can't answer calls and texts on this but you do get notification, I personally don't find this feature very useful. Overall decent buy I'd say."
25436,4,All the other features are very good and they are as precise as promised by the brand. The only issue I think is the battery does not last not even for 2 whole days whereas I don't even wear it to my bed.
25437,2,"Incompatible with ios i guess.Sometimes it gets disconnected too. Even I‚Äôm using the latest verions,it shows up to update the app or watch OS to change the clock faces."
25438,5,Superb watch Lots of Clock faces Ok for Activity tracking 2day battery backup only
25439,1,Not good
25440,4,The watch is good. Has good functionality. Battery life is 4 days+. Delivery was fast.
25441,4,Good watch
25442,1,Don't buy.starts malfunctioning after 10 days
25443,4,Worth it....
25444,1,Waste.. it's getting hung all the time..not able to complete a workout..
25445,5,Nice
25446,5,Very nice watch in a quite reasonable price. Lots of features. Loving it. Working good.
25447,4,"Nothing can be better than this product , good deal on Flipkart , I will suggest to buy this product without any confusion"
25448,5,Good one if you donot mind connecting to gps of phone. Has 3-4 days of charge. Readings are fairly accurate.
25449,4,Good deal. Amazing! The package had 2 belts as mentioned. bought it at a good discount
25450,5,Great product!!
25451,2,Not value for money..
25452,4,Nice watch
25453,5,Amazing
25454,5,Its value for money
25455,5,Thank you flipkart
25456,2,The batter back isn‚Äôt good also sometimes it fails to light up when you turn you wrist and you can get better options in this price range
25457,3,1.There was a bit of lag in the software response in touch. The step counter had much difference to the negligible value of error. 2. Connected GPS didn't work well either. It was disconnected most time. 3. The wifi connectivity issue with the device was worst. Most of the watch faces were not able to be downloaded. 4. Notification delay 5. One good thing was that the watch is super light and awesome strap (woven fabric) kind. You don't even feel that you've worn it. 6. Detailed sleep analy...
25458,4,It‚Äôs okay
25459,1,"After few months of use, its not starting. Once its out of warranty its of no use if your watch becomes bad as there is no service center. You mail your probz to customer care they will just feel ""sorry for your inconvenience"" and nothing else. It means in short buying such premium smartwatch has a validity of just 1 year. Go for another brand if you wanna buy Premium smart watches. Disappointed with such products from such big brands. Just a loot."
25460,5,Good So far...Loving it
25461,5,Value for money (Accurate results at every point) look is awesome
25462,5,Very good
25463,4,Classic watch
25464,5,Good product
25465,5,It's wow
25466,4,Classy product.but battery issue seen
25467,5,Nice watch.....
25468,4,"It does the same thing what other smart watches does, high price and less features compared with other watches  I have buy fitbit by watching many review and people are talking about accuracy and correction  I am not expert in reviewing the accuracy of the function but yes I am going to buy another smart watches under 2000 and then I can compare and say why other can take fitbit for 24000, such a huge amount.  3Star for the huge prices only rather is fine"
25469,5,"Awsm product at awsm price , Completely satisfactory. Fitibit is the one u can count on"
25470,3,"The watch looks fine but extra strip can't use as it is little bigger then the original one , can you help me to change ...and replace with new strip"
25471,5,Nice
25472,2,Battery was a bit not satisfactory
25473,5,Nice one
25474,3,Pros- Premium quality Brand value Multiple functions Sleek look Good sensitivity  Cons- Display could have been better; one would expect a better display quality looking at the price of the watch and fitbit brand name attached to it. App interface not very good. Couldn't find the used watch faces.
25475,1,Not good at all. I jave returned the product same day.
25476,2,Don't buy
25477,4,"Hardware is good, but lot of premium features in app."
25478,1,The Product was used and the extra strap was missing and the main strap was also broken
25479,2,Not worth buying it ....screen flickering issue
25480,5,Wonderful bought at 7300
25481,4,Got it in Big billion sale. Positives: Very light . Good software from fit bit tracks all activities. Has an additional belt. Con's: Not the latest features. Many priced below have more features. Only basic steps and heart rate. Strap quality doesn't instill confidence. Plastic feel to the tracker. No GPS/Compass.
25482,4,"Nice watch,but no phone notifications to watch.what is the process to do that."
25483,3,Very often syncing issues and bluetooth connection problems as there are 2 bluetooth connections required.I am disappointed the rest of the watch works fine however the software issues just cuts away the feel and purpose of the watch.
25484,4,Delivered on time. Good one. Looks good.
25485,1,"After a year i al writing this review. I did not use the watch for a month since my strap was broken.. i switched on the watch after the month and it never worked. Tried all possible solutions given in youtube and fibit forum but no luck. Buyers never buy this Fitbit product no service, no support and no guarantee. Spend little more and go with Apple or some other brand.  Seriously the worst product i ever used."
25486,1,Within 8 months display issue started and now it's not working at all and no support from either side.
25487,5,I was very doubtful if this was a right choice. Now I would not regret. Received it today. Set it all up for everything.  Loaded about 100 songs and can play via bluetooth speakers. Best part is I am able to connect to my phone and bluetooth headset at the same time. No difference in quality of sound (actually better than mobile. There is no gap between songs.)  A little time consuming to set up but once done its good to go.  The only thing missing would be inbuilt GPS. Its got everything. No...
25488,5,"Good watch good in quality, precision.  But some how it is not allowing me to update the clock faces and the firmware update is not up to the recent one"
25489,5,Best at this price
25490,4,Good Simple watch.
25491,1,"The only function it does is what a fit band does. Then why pay 10 times more. The message notification function doesn't work properly. And gets removed repeatedly making you reset ur device again and again. The call notification works, but u can't answer ur calls as it doesn't have a inbuilt mic or speaker. It's a total waste of money. Total loss. Requesting for a refund. Also before you buy this product please check on fitbit app if it supports ur device."
25492,5,Nice
25493,5,Very nice üëç all features are nice
25494,5,Sweet techy thing to have... And pretty cute...
25495,3,"Battery discharges within 3 days. You need to pay extra for paid subscription to use the features, the features which are usually bundled with watch purchase."
25496,3,Bike/cycle travelling KMs is not giving if phone not carried. Battery life is also not that good.
25497,5,Pros: 1. Accurate 2. Great community 3. Customisation  Cons: 1. Sync is not all that great. Takes time to get sync 2. Battery drains much faster with always on 3. Accessories are costly
25498,1,I bought versa last year and now it gets problem in Bluetooth and service center not found. Even I have reset the versa but some problem persist.
25499,5,"A smartwatch that works perfectly with both android and iOS. Fitbit has nailed it completely with it's Versa range. The design is sleek, very useful for people who are health-conscious and it offers value for money."
25500,2,"It's not good it's not just complete one year and charger is not working and watch belt is also damage according to cost, material is not good"
25501,5,Very nice really good product
25502,1,Worked well for 6 months and then one day while in use heated up. Burnt the wrist because of battery heating issue.
25503,1,Don't purchase fitbit brand because this is Chinese product. My fitbit watch stopped working after 6 month as well they don't want to exchange.
25504,5,No doubt... It's best in class
25505,5,Good one
25506,1,After 45 days of use my watch stopped working.. it has been 4 months but my watch is not replaced. No response from customer care. Very bad experience.
25507,5,"Except for logistical delay, everything else was perfect for this pick"
25508,3,Not much as expected
25509,5,Best smartwatch in this prive segment. Period. ...
25510,5,Best in class
25511,1,Worst don't buy it
25512,1,Strap is not durable. Broken within three months of usage. Please do not buy from this seller.
25513,1,This product waste
25514,1,Waste of money . Won't work after 6 months.
25515,1,Waste of money.. doesn't connect easily
25516,1,Do not buy this watch.Waste product.Im unable to sync with my phone.Very pathetic customer support too ..
25517,2,Not worth of the price
25518,1,syncing problem with iphone
25519,5,Amazing watch!
25520,2,"Using since months, watch is okay ok okay but the notifications are not working. Tried all the settings they are sync for some time and got disconnected again. Not sure. Upto fitness tracker I was satisfied."
25521,1,Poor
25522,1,"Bought this in July, calorie counting is like wayyyyyy off it literally shows you more than double calories. I mean who burns 7000 calories after a 6 hour walk.  Edit: Horrible, stopped syncing after 3 months of usage fitness tracking was average but calorie tracking was horrible. No customer support in India. I got and Samsung watch 3 which works like a charm and is overall very accurate in terms of fitness tracking. Don't buy fitbit ever."
25523,5,The watch Is good every thing fine but within 6 months the strap snapped. It was used with utmost care but still the strap just tore.
25524,3,Breakage product
25525,1,The worst thing ever i got in my life. I would rather give minus star rating
25526,4,Watch is undoubtedly good. But the strap is not upto the mark... It tore apart in 4 months
25527,1,Very bad watch charging problem accessories problem and customer care not supported for your problem.zero marking
25528,2,"i bought this watch just bcoz im a fitness enthusiast and wanted to track all the daily routines including my phone notification. after 4 days of using this watch notifications of my phone (including whatsapp, messages etc) has been stopped. i reset my watch is about 3-4 times and the problem is still the same but only one thing which i really like that whenever you workout or do any physical activities, this watch gives you real numbers (including your calories, steps, heart rate, sleep ti..."
25529,5,Bad product Not reading heart rate after 6 months
25530,5,Good product received and worth of money.
25531,1,Totally inaccurate!
25532,4,"Good product, but don't work smoothly with android device"
25533,4,"Nice watch , looks nice but is not a true health tracker. It cannot distinguish between treadmill and walking . Also calorie burn is different from what other machines show"
25534,5,Great watch..durable too
25535,5,Loved it
25536,5,Nice
25537,5,Very nice and so satisfied. Thanks
25538,2,Money waste
25539,1,Look wise it's good...but not accurate. MI band is much more accurate and cheaper comparitively.
25540,5,Nyc
25541,5,Very good product
25542,4,Nice watch
25543,4,Nice product
25544,5,Perfect
25545,5,"it's amazing, just go for it"
25546,4,good
25547,1,not able to connect with mobile and not even getting notifications and calls on my smart watch.not even worth it really unhappy
25548,3,"The watch looks good but the only issue we are facing is with the App. Very often we need to clear the cache and re-login the app, after every login we have to set the notifications."
25549,5,Berry ghatiya product
25550,3,I was not satisfied with this product.. the item was not fair and call notifications will come and message notifications are not come
25551,4,worth to spend on this product
25552,5,perfect...i got very good deal for 9000...it's been 3 months and no issues so far
25553,5,amazing and well fit to customers requirement. best price it was with all other online website.
25554,1,"watch is not at all user friendly. there is no customer care to contact. Please do not waste your money. from the day one i have purchased, synchronisation issue with phone and once i done factory reset, then watch power off for life time. i can not power on from the date i have done factory reset."
25555,5,amazing product
25556,5,Worth it. To keep tracks of your activities.üòä
25557,5,Nice watch.. Gifted wife on our marriage anniversary and she loved it..
25558,1,dont buy this watch. worst product
25559,5,Supergood.
25560,5,best
25561,2,"Product is good. Asthetics are to my taste. Pedometer isn't accurate. If you're traveling in a bus, it will calculate steps due to sheer vibrations. Battery life is good if you are not using notifications or connected GPS.  Now the worst part - Fitbit doesn't have a single service center any where in the world. So if you damage this watch, you will have to buy a new one. Period."
25562,5,nice
25563,5,Papa is very happy with the watch
25564,5,Full stylish ‚ù§Ô∏è
25565,2,"belt looks decent, but does not fit with the watch pins. You won't be able to use it."
25566,5,Amazing!! You can make your selfie pic as a clock background which feels just so good.
25567,3,it has some of technical issues like notification problem and it take lot of time to load maps.
25568,5,"synchronisation issue, good one to use"
25569,1,battery life is a serious problem.. after on update the battery does not last for even one full day.. been using amazefit.. it's so much better than this one..
25570,5,super
25571,5,"The watch doesn't show the notification of call or message, it always says pair the phone even after pairing the same, raised this issue to Fitbit multiple times, but no response yet."
25572,4,Very nice Fitbit Versa Smartwatch
25573,5,great product
25574,5,I just have praises for this watch
25575,4,base users for a activity trackers
25576,5,loving it.
25577,4,"Overall a good smartwatch. 24x7 heart rate monitor, notifications.. working perfectly with Galaxy M30s. Only negative is step counter is inaccurate."
25578,1,my product is not returned yet. how can the issue be resolved
25579,1,"Connectivity is totally disgusting, notifications never work. Cheaper Chinese watches are better in this regard"
25580,4,good in all aspects.
25581,1,There is a discolouration problem in 1 month. I am highly disappointed by flipkart and fitbit
25582,2,While calculating floors and exercise duration. It's highly inaccurate !!! So accuracy which is the main thing is major issue. Battery backup is good which is 3+ days.  Stopped working in 4 months only. And fitbit take a very very long time to replace your watch.
25583,4,ok
25584,1,"I am using this product from last 2 months, I am using oneplus 6 Mobile. 1) Connectivity Issues ( every time i use to go to settings and reconnect again) 2) Find My Device/Watch not available ( even MI band have this feature) 3) Only to view time and Fitness activities thats it. ( while going in bike also its counting the steps). Instead of this you can buy Mi Band to go with Fitness Activities and time."
25585,4,"Amazing product with one major flaw, it does not play stored songs properly through bluetooth speakers or earphones. The music either plays too fast or too slow. The only difference between versa and versa lite is versas song storage facility which in a way is waste as it does not play properly. save money go for versa lite."
25586,5,very good product...
25587,1,Connectivity issue.
25588,4,excellent watch...only issue is the charger has something inside which sounds something loose..but itz working
25589,2,The battery is not such a log lasting as given.lt give backup up to 80 hours
25590,5,super watch and nice color
25591,5,Awesome. Very Good watch in the category. Light in weight.
25592,4,good one
25593,2,"Not so great!! decent on external, very primitive inside!! light-years to catch-up with what Apple watch offers!! Except for the price, pretty disappointed!!"
25594,4,There is some variance between actual steps and fitbit count...but over all its a superb product
25595,2,very bad.step count incorrect always. waste of money
25596,1,not as expected. 1. Sleep data not correct. 2. Wrist belt is irritating. 3. poor battery. 4. many features are paid and synchronisation after many failed attempt. poor connectivity. .
25597,5,good product fantastic delivery and price by Flipkart thank you Flipkart
25598,5,good one
25599,5,good and accurate
25600,2,It does not have built in GPS and it does not calculate distance accurately. It also does not have walk option in the exercises.
25601,5,very good
25602,1,worst wate of money dont buy display problem with in 20 days it was dead
25603,4,Really good watch worth buying
25604,1,Got it for reasonable price on big billion day..Just after few days of usage the smart watch is getting synced but display is not working..Raised concern to fitbit and replacement order was placed.Did not expect such poor quality from Fitbit.
25605,1,"notification service does not runs on my device, always shows an error message in a red banner in the fitbit app"
25606,5,worth buying....
25607,1,Charger stopped working within 10 days of purchase. Please do some quality checks before handling the product
25608,1,No meeting my expectation as it is not compatible with one plus 5 and it is not mentioned on the app.
25609,3,working as per review but little costly
25610,3,watch is good but app not working properly.. some times i am not able to see notifications in fitbit..
25611,3,Not as expected due to connectivity issues that it has with my one plus phone. Otherwise it is fine but not a value for money buy as spending 8000 for this watch is waste. Could be a steal if available at 4k.
25612,5,nice product....
25613,1,Not worth the price. Step tracking is inaccurate. The band adds car and bike ride as steps. Didn‚Äôt expect this from Fitbit
25614,5,perfect for health reasons
25615,5,super product and delivery on Time üëç
25616,5,go for it guys rocking
25617,1,the Charger is not working and it‚Äôs only been 21 days since I bought it. I don‚Äôt want to recommend it. High risk
25618,4,excellent fitness tracker and a fancy watch
25619,1,In just 5 months this watch stopped working! Requested from Fitbit for replacement and the procedure is so confusing! Not worth the money paid
25620,5,Fantastic watch ..specially for fitness
25621,5,very nice watch received two days before the delivery date and awesome features .
25622,5,awesome product happy to buy this üëç
25623,1,Not good product. Starting for about 10days it was showing correct data. After that it show same results of bpm of all
25624,4,good
25625,2,it's not connected to mobile for calls and messages alerr
25626,1,is it compatible to one plus 5T...i am facing compatible problem.
25627,5,Wonderful Watch with wonderful price..
25628,1,it's not a smart watch which can receive or reply to phone call or WhatsApp message it's a normal fitness band
25629,5,great product
25630,2,"It doesn't feel like a premium watch. Also, the sensors that wake it up are less effective, One has to shake the wrist to wake it up"
25631,4,doesn't support notifications in one plus 6
25632,5,Very nice smart watch. I got in the big billion days . Delivery was on time.
25633,4,very good product with great features
25634,4,good watch.... only lacking call facility
25635,5,Loving this watch thanks to Flipkart for such offer.
25636,2,Counts steps while driving as well as just moving hand back and forth. Expected a lot better product at this price
25637,1,Everytime I'll have to update my watch and it takes like 5 years to update üò†
25638,1,expectation is more while buying but after wearing the smart watch it didn't reach the level very difficult to add a Bluetooth device and adding songs.....
25639,3,Everything is good except I received Chinese variant of the device and the connectivity issue with OP6T
25640,5,"Monitor whole day, involvement and monitoring is design perfectly that make you busy and conscious about losing weight burning calories , listing music as well as controlling breathing & BPM"
25641,2,The product was not as per expectation.
25642,5,genuine product
25643,5,Great product
25644,3,Durablity is good but walking step is not accurate
25645,5,Nice Watch for the Amount
25646,5,awesome.....
25647,3,"Unfortunately I couldn't get any option to get notifications in my Redmi phone..Kindly help..if it doesn't support ,then it will be a waste of money for me!"
25648,5,Excellent product... good to go
25649,5,nice product
25650,2,"i am kind of unhappy wit this , other features are good bt it isn't appropriate atall. sometimes it automatically increases steps while being on rest mode , the fun fact is i remove my watch and sleep amd the other day i see 500 calories burned like i didn't even wear it"
25651,1,Flipkart has provided me a faulty piece or the watch itself is faulty. It is not able to get the notification from my phone. Tried a lot. worst product
25652,1,worst watch
25653,4,stylish and fantastic
25654,4,ok
25655,5,excellent watch
25656,5,best price and good buy
25657,4,the reason why I am giving 4 is it is not syncing with my phone automatically.
25658,5,come with more than expected features.ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞love it.
25659,3,"delivery was so poor, item is nice"
25660,5,Good
25661,2,"Terrible setup experience. Nothing works seamlessly. And Linux is not supported for music uploads, etc."
25662,1,disconnects very frequently with my one plus 6 and then again takes 30minutes to add again ! and doesn't show any notifications! and delivery took 12 days ! worst buy ever !
25663,1,Not connecting for not working properly
25664,5,Nice product
25665,5,very nice
25666,1,Not fully compatible with one plus 6T. Having Notification issue.
25667,3,It's nice but it's Chinese variant
25668,5,Nice watch
25669,1,Very poor quality. Has completely gone dead in one day of usage after factory resetting. Wastage of money.
25670,5,Product is good....look and Activities tracking is nice.
25671,4,beautiful watch
25672,5,Trustworthy companion throughout the clock
25673,4,cool
25674,5,Best smart watch üòçüòçüòç
25675,5,nice product. have been using it for almost a week. got it at a good discounted rate on flipkart.
25676,5,good one
25677,1,"The product doesn't want to start unless the update is done. I spend more than half a day to sort it out, but never successful. In 2019 if few kb data will download forever, then I can't image the build quality. I was very excited for the purchase, but now I regret it"
25678,3,update is taking too much time and adding music to watch also little bit tough. screen resolution is not much. and sometimes connecting with phone also takes much time
25679,1,waste item
25680,5,got it for 7K best in the price range
25681,5,Beautiful and lightweighted watch. Came with extra pair of small and large sized wrist band.
25682,4,"The Watch is good, but the android app is so bad it took nearly 3 hours to update the watch"
25683,5,amazing
25684,1,"Expectations High but sad, not connecting With Bluetooth"
25685,5,"my product has delivered at timely.and i would like to this smartwatch.build quality and design is good,also packing is good.thank u"
25686,5,it's counting steps even while sleeping...its not worth
25687,3,"If like me, you are looking for a GPS watch, it isn't. It is a connected GPS watch which means GPS is connected via your phone. Hence you need to carry your phone will running which destroys it very purpose."
25688,3,"seemes like sent me a used product, the model is of 2017, I was suspicious as the price was pretty low, it works ok for now"
25689,3,"The Bluetooth connectivity goes away in short while. And the notifications does not show up in the watch, except the call. It asks to restart the phone, but even after that nothing changes. you have to install and uninstall the fitbit app every now and then which can never be a permanent solution.  So basically, I am not at all satisfied.  though the heart rate and the steps count is authentic."

25698,5,Worth more than the amount. Best DSLR for a good beginner. Friendly camera. Love it. ‚ù§Ô∏è Extremely good with canon 50mm f1.8 STM lens.
25699,4,The camera simply awesome..and it is a best budget DSLR and begginer DSLR for first time user...auto focus mode works good in daylight
25700,5,product really great . I am totally sctified this product .really good camera for beggner .but flash button was missing that is not good .and capture is 18 mp wasn't good I was hopeed it will be 24 mp . it is also missing .n everything is good .
25701,3,Satisfied with the product.. Its a really good for all who wants to learn photography its a gem and love.... Go for itt....10/10

25704,5,Verry Nice and for My Opinion is great camera For this Price Range. I love it my first DSLR...! üëç Lot of Experiments Is easy with This DSLR .üòé
25705,4,Best in price segment. If you have skill this entry level dslr can do much better result. Just Dont expect much.
25706,4,"Camera is good for beginner. But not getting that much high quality pics from this camera or lens. So I order canon 50mm just after my 1st vacation, when I was not satisfied with the quality.. Check you tube regarding the comparison of 18mm and 50mm lens. If you want to buy camera than only kit lens is not just you want from your pics. You have to upgrade with any prime lens,whether it's 50mm or 55-250mm. Thanks"
25707,5,excellent dslr and get a free moto headset worth 6500 I am happy
25708,5,everything is perfect And specially the packaging it was so good .. When it arrived I got surprised because of the carry case I didn't expected that .. thank you so much Flipkart
25709,5,"My first DSLR. good one for beginners. easy to use. worth for money. and as always, super fast delivery by Flipkart. loved it"
25710,5,Camera doesn't matter if you have skill you still click photos like this and lences also define your clicks but if you don't have budget then this camera is for you it is best camera for learning Photography but if you have a little more budget then try to buy at least 1300d or 1500d theses are not great cameras but better then 3000d
25711,4,"good camera n it's my first DSLR I loved it. But delivery took so long. I got camera bag, camera and lense, 16gb card, batter with charger lense cap and carry strap. good camera for beginners."
25712,5,it's clearly evident that's it not a high budget camera. but it's best for everyone looking for a Pocket friendly dslr. specifically for college students and for domestic use.
25713,5,I was planning to buy Dslr for long time. it's really good camera for beginners level photography and of course if any one have ability to shoot good quality photos may take easily with it. Delivery is very fast. Thanks flipkart for providing low cost pocket friendly opportunity on big billion day sale offer.
25714,5,AWESOME DSLR AT THIS PRICE. I HAD A DREAM TO BUY A DSLR .THE MOMENT I BOUGHT THIS DSLR MY DREAM HAS TOTALLY FULLFIL. WAIT LISTENüôè. TO BE HONEST IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT TO START YOUR OWN BLOG OR ANY KIND OF YOUTUBE CONTENT THEN PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BUY DSLR FOR PHOTOSHOT THEN JUST GO FOR IT. AT ANY POINT OF TIME IF YOU THINK THAT YOU NEED MORE QUALITY IN PHOTOS YOU CAN EASILY ADD LENS‚ù§Ô∏è. THANK YOU.
25715,5,Its a wonderful camera for the beginners. Those who have passion in photography and love to shoot its a good choice for them. Trust Canon !
25716,4,Excellent for someone who is new into photography..it gives you flexibility to try out a lots of manual settings just like any expensive dslr..even with kit lens you can click wonderful pictures...Clarity is not that great...For better clarity go for an expensive dslr
25717,5,Good one Best for beginner photographs Not recommend for videography because it is not good for videography or vloging porpes it is heavy and bulky. So if you're priority is photography it's a nice and value for money product.
25718,5,Best DSLR in this price range and if you are a beginner then you should buy it . And this is canon. Entry level camera in this price range i bought at 20k and know current price is 27k around i am happy to grap under 21k . Its just amazing just buy it you will not regret. Microshot is working perfectly.
25719,5,All over great camera nice quality of pictures i took and auto focus mode is work just awesome
25720,5,"It's a great deal, images are good, go for it, nice camera for beginners,images videos were amazing, if your budget was less then 30k then go for it don't think to much, I personally liked it. Thanku flipkart for this and for 1 day delivery."
25721,5,"Worth Buying ... Superb !! Loved it !! Bulit quality is lil disappointed if we are careful it's ok,overall can fully satisfy in dis price ..."
25722,5,"-Trusted seller with genuine product as shown in the image,from these seller one plus point is you can buy a cheapest dslr online in offer time. -Nice product in this price segment I bought this camera in big billion sale at cheap price,I am sharing some pictures capture with 3000D with 18-55 kit lense. -Its good for biginners. -Easy to use camera. - Switch to any mode it's 'ON' and for switch 'Off' there is a mode on same dial."
25723,4,The product is awesome for a beginner in the photography world it's preety good in this price range I have been using it since 1 week and I personally recommend to go with it by closing your eyes.
25724,4,The product is very good But if I take another lens of 55-250mm lens Then it's amazing so take it for photography And it's best for beginners
25725,5,Great product. worth of price.. Thanks flipkart for delivering it in 3 days.. I love it... My first DSLR
25726,5,"Just bought it on the offer period for 16800, the product is well worth for the price I believe... this is my first dslr so I think I may be exaggerating , but its a good buy. Visually, the build quality has a premium quality , the quality of the images are good, rich and vibrant, although there is considerable amount of noise in them especially in artificial lighting conditions, buy a prime lens if you want the best quality photos from this one... the buttons are tactile but the screen is be..."
25727,5,"it's a good DSLR to own if u are not a pro and looking for entry level DSLR. This camera comes with 16GB card, and 18-55 lense kit. Then buy separate Fixed Focus Lense for close-ups. This will b a perfect Device then. wifi connection allows u to connect it directly to ur PC or Mobile. Easy to use user interface. strong and sturdy body. battery backup is good."
25728,3,Excellent piece of product for simple usage and can take nice shots of closer locations. Zoom option is not up to the mark and works like any other DC. Faced difficulties capturing a still image of moving objects.
25729,5,"A decent entry level DSLR. Very glad that it was bundled with a carry case.  The lens is decent for beginner level and some advanced level photography.  For the price I bought it, I can not say how glad I am."
25730,5,"Guys please check the charger and battery when you receive the product. Fortunately my charger is not working fine, I gave it(charger) at canon service center for replacement. if the battery is not working we need pay the money from our pocket and that too we haven't check within ten days...  please use as early as possible one received the product....  One more important thing for any replacement is also take more time..."
25731,5,"Superb product at great price! The class of image which a true blue DSLR can give you is unmatched by even a top end mobile camera. This model is so good, gives the full feel of a heavy duty DSLR while being light on the pocket. The complimentary memory card and camera bag were a welcome bonus, the bag is of good quality. When you hold a Canon camera, you have the assurance and confidence of a top notch product."
25732,5,"Best camera ever. It's my first DSlr, never a disappointed. If you beginner that's have you. Go for it And just click result is awesome. Love you flipkart and love you very much nikon‚ù§Ô∏è"

25735,5,By my side nice dslr in short range facilities and perfection is very gud. this is not for professional camera bt its img quality like pro.. tnx
25736,3,if you want a good video recording and good full HD pictures so you have to try some other DSLR otherwise it is good for simple use.
25737,4,"I purchased this as my first DSLR. Still, I am learning. Mostly I am using auto mode only, and use manual mode occasionally. I got very good photos of my car to be posted on CarSangrah. It helped me getting good response."
25738,5,"I purchased this last in the month of October after using roughly almost 7-8 months I can say this camera is a gem for beginners and for pro guys you'll not dissatisfied with the quality of camera , image capture quality. good battery backup high quality lense high quality cables even carry case is also good yeah bag looks little old fashioned but who cares about the bag when you have very decent camera at this price range"
25739,5,camera is good but if u are new to use it I would recommend that go for device having LCD screen it will be easy to use. other wise product is good at this price.
25740,5,awsome product and super fast delivery by ekart and the packing of the product was also good...thanks flipkart for ur super fast service
25741,5,A full featured DSLR with a good quality image sensor. It has all the features that are required for a mid level amateur. In skilled hands it is an awesome tool.
25742,5,As like always Canon is perfect in all manner.. super pick by this price range. loved it
25743,5,"Very good camera, the blurr effect works properly here. A good one for new photographers. The camera is having ES mode also."
25744,4,"Guys, I have been using this DSL for almost 2 months, Image quality is very good in good lighting conditions, much better than our mobile phone cameras and indoor performance also good with flash but you can't use it without flash in low lighting condition.  Pros - Decent image quality for this price range. Decent battery life to take 600 photos in single charger. Wi-Fi function with canon app to download photos to smartphone easily.  Cons Fully Auto mode could have been better. On/off ..."
25745,4,amazing camera @ such price Range Display pixel is low but clearity in images we seen in mob laptops etc _ Best Camera Recommended for New users Better than my Nikkon D3400
25746,4,this camer is the perfect one in this because range for photography although it has okay kind video feature but beyon that its perfect for a beginners...it can shoot in raw...which i qs not expecting n evething is so simple to understand in this...im perfectly statisfied with camera .?
25747,5,Nice decent camera. worth every penny. got it for 19k during but billon day. lightweight. WiFi enabled: camera connect app Iain Google pay should be installed to use also can use mobile as remote for taking pictures when connected through WiFi.
25748,5,"Terrific purchase.. I would like say before judging this product on the basis of looks and picture posted by others for this product won't give much exposure. For whom just want to buy a dslr I would say better get some knowledge about DSLR first how to operate it like what is aperture, focal length and shutter speed. Once you have this knowledge you can do anything and everything about photography with this product."
25749,5,I thin it was awesome.... I liked very much...... I am a beginner..... I really like my camera EOS 3000D..... NICE Pic clarity...... Lite wait..... Simple functioning..... I like very much.....
25750,4,Entry level DSLR. If the usage is only for family and trips then its for you. worth the price. capturing photos when screen is on is lagging but works perfect when shot with view finder. Build quality is good
25751,3,product is good nice product in best budget battery backup is not good i didnt like the batery i m going to change the battery it offs suddenly even in a full charge
25752,5,what to say. just the best cam for amature photography enthusiasts. I mostly use it as point and shoot during family functions and spl occasions. works superb. it's pretty fast in taking pics in auto mode and offers all the basic modes as in most cameras but with exceptional picture clarity. just go for it if you are looking for cheap camera and professional quality photos. there is hardly any other camera in the market that offers the same value for money.
25753,5,"thks for fk for gud deal offer. thks to seller for timely despatch and safe packing. it's a gud deal for this money, gud for beginners. I gifted it for my dad."
25754,4,nice but little old lens. good for entry level. if you got extra bucks go for a better model.
25755,5,"Wow what an excellent product i'm so lucky to bought this camera is very less price and its working superbly, i recommend to all who want to try DSLR in beginning level, this camera giving you all what you want at initial level.. Thank you flipkart and Canon"
25756,4,"Best Entry Level DSLR in this range. My first DSLR. Loved It. Good delivery, thank you Flipkart !"
25757,5,"Nice Camera in Great Price, Good for photo passionate"
25758,5,its the best DSLR in the price range of below 20k .its a basic model..so don't expect more..but yes its far better than point to zoom cams......doesn't have good zoo.... could have been better...I purchased for 18990/- on big billion day sale...till now I m in learning mode...I m just exploring all the options
25759,5,thanks ekart to deliver 1 day before . thanks to flipkart to shipped at time . And deliver good product no any issue . when open cannon . picture quality is good . this is for new comer on photography . Image quality is good .
25760,4,Camera is very good to take pictures and easy to handle. I am facing only problem of focus. If rotate the zoom to take close photo then it is not clear. May be i am not aware to set properly zoom. Otherwise in open area this is very good. Even can take photos of hills and from long distance.
25761,4,Since this is my first DSLR so I give it 4 stars (after using it for a day) as I don't have anything to compare it with. But this has got all the features that a begginer can think of. Though an Auto Flash and a Metal Lens Mount (metal being more durable) could have added the fifth star to my rating. Picture quality is good considering 18 MP camera you can't expect more. Upgrade the lens if you want to have a better experience. I am not much worried about the video quality as I bought this fo...
25762,5,"Amazing camera for beginners. It really allows you to learn basics of photography like shutter speed, iso, aperture etc. I recommend every beginner to first learn how to use this one thoroughly and then move on to professional level cameras like 80D or 5D."
25763,4,Good one for a beginner.. Functionality is really good and worth the price. Loving it actually! but there should have been a cap for the display. That would make it perfect.
25764,5,excellent product and fast delivery by Flipkart. found very good and offer provided was a very good deal for beginners. already 1 month over and all working in good way. original product.
25765,4,it's awesome gift... always thnkful papa..I feel very happy .. it's good working...and very clean photo..
25766,5,Very Good Result But Not For Photographer in Studio Use . Studio Light Triger Nit Supported But Family Use Best Camera Under 25 k
25767,5,Good quality product for the price. Photo quality is commendable and iinbuilt wifi is an advantage as it can be used to wirelessly use camera for capture and data transfer. Even the video quality is very nice at1080p.

26020,4,Good 1
26021,5,I bought this camera in the year 2018 for 16K giving this review after more than 2yreas of using. Its a complete satisfaction I must say. With its wifi and remote photography options what more can you expect at this price. It a perfect choice for some who wants to learn.
26022,5,"everything reached in a perfect shape without any damage , cam is too good , but should be bought only with the zoom lens, kit lens is not that much useful.features are awesome. it is wifi enabled to share your photos. thorugh wifi u can connect ur mobile ,which can show the live cam screen on your mobile . flash is good i got it at 21500 without zoom lens. upto now there r no reasons to mark it a bad one ,except the reasons to say it is an awesome product at such a price."
26023,5,Good to start
26024,5,"Got it for 20k flat ! Excellent product for beginners and learners ! It even comes with a free learning courseware subscription the box ! Only thing tou need to take care is that the Mount ring lacks steel reinforcement, so lens changes need to be carefully done...."

26063,4,Nice
26064,3,Too good
26065,1,There is a problem in auto zoom. It takes a lot of time in stabilizing the focus. I tried a lot to return and sorder a higher version ..but Flipkart policy has changed and this is creating a problem for us.  I request Flipkart to consider return also...not just replacement.. because we put a lot of money in products and if that comes out to be bad...then we are stuck. I'll make sure not to order anything . Would prefer buying it after testing in the market .. paying a bit more .. Atleast 500...
26066,4,good

26090,4,Good
26091,5,Image reasult is awesome Camera quality so good
26092,4,Camera is amazing. But i didn't get memory card and bag with it so a lil bit disappointed. But overall the camera is awesome Ho for it i got is for 22k I'd suggest you to buy it in big billion days you may get it for 18 to 19k rupees.
26093,1,If you're Planning to buy this camera for video shoot then you are going to do a big mistake because it's video quality is too much poor .
26094,5,Very nice camera... But main thing is that I don't know some of its functions so after using 3-4 months I will give my review again
26095,5,Blur system is very good
26096,4,Good
26097,5,Good product
26098,5,So Nice.I love this
26099,3,Camera is good but storage is not enough camera quality is very nice this is expensive but according to price features very less.
26100,4,Good product for the price range.

26103,4,Awesome in this price range great quality
26104,5,Good
26105,5,Very good photo
26106,1,Wast of mony
26107,5,"Product is very good. Got in okay condition, but Flipkart has not packed it safely as it's a sophisticated product which needs to be packed for safety during shipping. And secondly I want to mention this time Flipkart fooled me by not giving the camera bag with the pack. Memory card is also excluded from the pack. Atleast bag should be there."
26108,5,Very good camera but hotshoe system is not satisfied
26109,4,Excellent product
26110,5,Always guves a crisp image. Best for beginner. And I am a beginner.
26111,3,"At least it should have the basic accessories like beg, datacable to connect to or laptop and a memory card.... top of the camera need to expend more then 5k to buy basic accessories."
26112,4,Best option as an entry level DSLR. And with 18-55 lens still manages to get background blurred pictures.
26113,4,"Two reasons for not rating 5 stars. One, I would have paid a bit more for a memory card too. Please include it, it's not complete without one. Two is more a camera display issue- it tends to randomly become quite white. I just passed my return by date, so I can't return, but it's a random issue. I've seen that reinserting the battery solves it."
26114,5,At this price..it is okay.but if you are expecting professional quality fotography then it is not for you..Go for some higher price model.
26115,5,Good product
26116,4,Excellent product the picture is much more good
26117,5,Very good
26118,5,Nice
26119,5,Good for entry level. I bought is super cheap at 19k. Wait for offers.. if want a bit better one go for 1500d

26246,1,"Worst product for those who prefers video recording,they haven't mentioned it in description also,even the display size is less than the lower model 1300.it is simply waste. Better to go with some products of nikon."

26248,5,1500d is batter than 3000d i have expressed both 1500d have batter functions than 3000 before buy compare led size auto open flash and one click on and off option awailable
26249,4,"One of the best DSLR cameras for the beginners although I don't know much about photography took this camera as it was there in incredible deal of 20,000. The camera has no built in flash you have to buy a seperate flasher from the market or from Flipkart. The packing and the delivery from flipkart was smooth."

26283,4,"Overall product is good. Light weight, easy to handle. The only issue is, in description. They said there is 30x optical zoom whereas it only zoom upto 3x with 18-55mm lens, so it is my humble request to FLIPKART sales team to review the description once on their end before putting it on website."

26993,2,"Using it for quite some time. Fellow buyers, please don't get too much impressed with all these positive reviews. Even if price drops to 20000 during sale, its not worth it. Image quality is just like a smartphone. LCD screen has very very few pixels, so you can't use it in live view mode and also can't actually analyse picture you have just clicked. Autofocus is generally slow in live view mode in most of dslr but in this camera, it is very very slow. Image has too much noise in indoor shot..."

27054,4,Best in class for a beginner
27055,3,The build quality is ok .....plastic but looks good . For a entry level camera its best in this price range . But you want a serious photography career then nikon is best .....the natural colour is better in nikon. It has one issue sometimes you can't able to take picture with flash mode on in Auto mode.....still I m struggling to solve this .....its a bad experience with this dslr. But picture quality is good for a entry level dslr.
27056,5,Value for money! I loved it ???

27066,4,"It's a great entry level dslr. If you are new into the photography or video making then you may go for this product. But i would suggest you to buy Canon 1500D, if you can. After you will be used to this product then you will feel like you have to upgrade but you may not be able to buy the new one. So, go for Canon 1500D if you are buying this, if you can't afford that, then you may go for this one. At last you are the user, you must know what to buy, Do some research on what you really need."

You can not connect a lapel mic to it and it also doesn't have any speaker. It also doesn't have an on off switch. Rest features & picture quality is good.

27697,5,Product was awesome
27698,5,"Canon says ""Delighting you always"". Well, am delighted! First impression, I love the camera and the accessories provided. Choosing 50mm prime lens was the best option. I don't feel to remove the lens out of my camera because the lens is that good. Buy additional memory card and a battery (LP-E10) for professional use. Simple and easy to navigate. Good beginner's camera ‚ò∫Ô∏è you can get best photos with it. Highly recommended!"

27804,5,"I'm not good photographer, so with my limited knowledge and usage, I'd say camera is more than value for money. Yes, pics quality is good, in both day & night (using flash). A lens and a camera kit bag which comes as supplement is an added benefit to carry & handle the camera safer during outing. Needless to say flipkart's service as it was delivered as promised!!!! Overall, considering it's price,this camera basic DSLR model, will be useful for the beginners."

Autofocus is nice and 5fps is working well for me... 300mm lens is OK... need to get another one since i mostly do birds.. need more zoom üòä Overall its a great camera for beginners!!!!"
29108,5,"Awesome product. If you are looking for semi-pro DSLR you can buy this without it thinking. Easy handling, easy handy features"
29109,5,"Best Mid range camera for photography lovers. I am writing the review after 3 months of using this cam , this is my 1st DSLR canon is a user friendly cam, it is basically good for videography. Nikon is quite hard to use,. it is best for photos if you want to upgrade your photography Tallents , and you are looking for a mid range cam ,. 100% go for it., lenses are good, 70-300 mm lens is mind-blowing output. so, go for dual lenses"
29110,5,If you confused between nikon d5600 and canon 200d then go with nikon d5600 without thinking again. It is very good camera with excellent features. The camera features 39 autofocus point helps us to focus faster and produces clear image. I share some images of the camera sample hope you like it.
29111,5,"Excellent camera for beginner photographers and also a best back up for pro also. Amazing colour depth, fast focusing, crystal clear photo. Lightweight is a advantage while you are travelling. Vary angle screen is very useful when taking ground level shots or over the crowd shots and very helpful for blogging purpuse also. You can attach external mic. Battery life is very good. Through WiFi and snapbridge downloading photos in smartphone from camera is too easy. It supports Bluetooth also. I..."
29112,5,"I think this the best entry level dslr in this range. I got a 18-55mm kit lense, 16gb memory card and lowepro bag. Bag quality is good. This model is good because you are getting a touch screen enabled dslr in the price range where most of other brands giving non touch screen models. Some features like very easy to operate, touch screen, fast auto focus and sharp images make this dslr a best entry level dslr. I am attaching some pictures clicked with this dslr(flipkart not letting me add more..."
29113,5,"You can't have a better mid-range DSLR. However I don't like 18mm-55mm lens, but you'll get sharp and crisp photos with 70mm-300mm lens. The camera is feature loaded and very light. You'll love it."
29114,5,"Wow, love the Camera....I have already used Nikon d 3500 in my Laboratory but this camera is far better. Flipkart delivered at time and the product was at best conditions. This is my first personal DSLR, so guys after using for 2 weeks, I must say that go for it, there is no other camera which could provide same level as Nikon d 5600. Colour tone production, lots of effect, smooth touch screen, good battery life, etc. Just go for it."
29115,5,No doubt Nikon's lineup for intermediate DSLR are catchworthy . but one must also invest in additional lenses to get the most out of d5600 . like in my case I ordered 35mm 1.8g lens when paired with d5600 produced great results . not going over the specifications. camera is just awesome produces detailed and sharp images .  70-300 lens do have its own advantages .but after 250mm its just doesn't perform up to the mark.but hey! you get this in that price bracket which is fine to me .  guid...
29116,5,"My First DSLR and the best decision that I made. The KIT lenses are not so ideal for lowlight photography but you can always get the best out of it. Overall very satisfied with the quality of photos, camera body and lens to start the learning process."
29117,5,"Excellent wow, what a camera! value for money, must buy. best entry lebel camera. flipkart delivery is so fast. very good packaging. no 1 genuine product."

29119,4,Good semi professional dslr from Nikon. Packing is good and the product is really nice. Not recommended for professional photographers and good for a beginner. It's features are best in class and have a good quality material in real. It's touch function is lit. Rotating screen helps in taking photos or record videos in selfie mode or in certain positions. The bag which is packed with the camera will only have the space to adjust lesser items. For a professional photographer it is recommended ...

29122,5,Best DSLR for beginners..don't think too much just click buy now..!I purchased on bbday with a great deal but i bought single lens. So i suggest please if you want more depth or wildlife photography then go for 70-300 mm also. Even though it can deliver good photos with this 18-55 mm lens. Thanks to Flipkart for the great package and delivery. Happy click..!
29123,4,Reviewing after using for an year. This is my first dslr and It gives stunning images. The 70-300 lens is simply awesome and thats the one I use the most. Autofocus while taking video is really bad. It cant focus well on moving objects. Even for slowly moving subjects it doesn't focus well. I think Canon200d is good if you prefer videography as it has much faster autofocus although the price is much higher than Nikon D5600 .But if your preference is only photography then go for it as it is a...
29124,5,"Cant say anything about the DSLR right now cause I am learning how to shoot but flipkart delivered it in a safe packaging and on time..  Edited on 16 Jan 2020 So, now I am using this for last 6 months and I want to say best in this price. I am not highlighting the features which all dslr have. but the best features which you will get in this price which none other dslr can give you today are 1. Articulated Touch screen. 2. Wifi transfer. 3. 39 AF point  Just go for it. Its a big plus. check o..."
29125,4,The camera is excellent. Probably the best one in this price range. Completely happy with the camera.  Would like to mention that the bag I received is a good quality Nikon original bag.  Giving 4 stars because it took 14 days to get the product delivered despite of having a Flipkart plus membership.
29126,5,"This is one step above the Entry level ( Nikon D3*** series). Pro - Light weight , Easy to handle , wifi , articulated screen . Image Quality is good . Low light performance is good . Better than expected. Snapbridge for your easy file tranfer Can shoot Raw + Jpeg Best in Mid level DSLR I had got a ridiculous deal with 18-55 and 70-300 deal. Thanks to Flipkart.  Cons - insufficient grip . Those who are new to DSLR won't find this . But the ones who are trying to upgrade this will disappoi..."
29127,5,"It was delivered in good condition. When it comes to camera, it is really good and easy to use. Good choice for a beginner."
29128,4,Awesome product but came with worst packaging. The seal of the packaging box was open. Flipkart should show some effort in packing camera like they do in mobiles. About the camera I would say that it's one of the best dslr in its class. But flipkart providing only 8gb card instead of 16gb. Rest the product is all good. Happy imaging.
29129,5,iam surprised. great dslr at this price range.. better to handle.. user friendly cam.. low light picsüí• .. really loved it !!
29130,5,"Great APSC DX camera which stand besides the Big brother D7100 & D7200. Instead of thease it have a Articulated Screen with Touch function, its a great option for those looking Midranged entry leval DSLR. U can also check D5500 & D5300. overall its a great deal. If u dont mind about your pocket then u can choose D7100 or D7200."
29131,5,pros : Beginner level camera bast for YouTube purpose focusing is fast in photo only build quality is amazing effects extra feature is best for quick retouching zooming and Focusing very perfect inbuilt mic plus sound battery backup amazing  cons : Difficult to learn User interface Bag quality is worst low performance in videography only 16Gb memory card provided  overall best
29132,5,It's amazing . I liked it. I order it in 15.2.20 and it came in 18.2.20 fast delivery. And the photos are also good.
29133,5,Great camera for all beginners. I have been using it for an year. Great specs with this price. If you just a photography enthusiast then u should go for it.
29134,5,Nic camera. And Good and great quality of images and. Auto focus is excellent. Pixel density is Assom and mind blowing. Best dslr for mid level and professional photographer
29135,5,Great quality ... It's not a beginner camera ... It's a middle professional camera ... Good image quality ... I loved it
29136,4,every thing works fine except for auto focus excellent for photos terrible for videos one thing this camera can improve on is autofocus love the manual flash option for in built flash
29137,5,"Great camera for beginners and go for it if you are one. If you have a heavy pocket, my suggestion is to go for a full-frame(sensor) camera instead of this. This one is great, but eventually you'll need to upgrade to full-frame as you evolve and no longer be a beginner in photography.  Overall it's a good package with a wide range of lens compatibility, not only from Nikon but from other manufacturers as well."
29138,5,one of the best DSLR for beginners.. I upgraded from D3200 to D5600.. I'm loving it üòä
29139,4,awesome product for great value 36k I got this product at 36k which was awesome.and its genuine product criss checked with nikon site.go for it guys
29140,5,I am writing the review after one week of usage...  The product is just awesome! Performs very well in both indoor and outdoor photography. Low light performance is also upto the mark. Love this product. Unbeatable in this price range. 70-300 mm lens is adding more flavour to it‚ô•Ô∏è. Video recording is a bit concern. But never regret after buying it
29141,5,Worth for money. Packing was good and everything claimed by Flipkart was there in the box. Nikon D5600 is really a DSLR camera with a lot of functions and an excellent quality of pics.
29142,5,it is a good camera in a reasonable price.it is easy to handle and has descend battery back up.it was delivered safely.
29143,5,Camera nd picture qlty is so nice. Delivery is also fine. This camera fullfill all the need. It work fine nd battery backup also fine. Nikon is best for Picture Quality and colours.
29144,4,"Camera is pretty darn good as mentioned by other people. Bag was just pure awfulness, wore out in a few days."
29145,5,Writing review after usage. very good camera and clarity also good. 70 to 300 lens is very good. Best camera at this price for beginners. I am also beginner and added my photos
29146,5,Awesome purchase. Auto focussing and different effects are really positive of this product. Very impressive and easy to carry and handling.
29147,5,Excellent buy. Camera with 18-140mm lens is quite compact for DSLR standards. Nikon interface is easy to use for the first time Nikon buyers. Touch has right sensitivity and response . that really helps to focus the object with a touch of the finger rather than fiddling around with buttons. Images are quite sharp even on 140mm range.  Flipkart delivery was a let down. delivery executive just handed over the package to security gate without informing me. And the package was crushed outside. L...
29148,5,I have uploaded unboxing video on my YouTube channel ''Kushagra Porwal '' and firstly I have decided to buy Nikon D5300 instead of D5600 but only screen difference is there in both the cameras that D5300 has not a touch screen and D5600 has a touch screen and Nikon D5600 has a great video quality and has more functions Very good camera just go for it without any confusion and photo and video quality is also awesome. The camera has a flip screen which helps you to take selfies and is also goo...
29149,5,"After too much of research i decided to buy d5600 with 18-140mm lens. Any beginner planning to buy DSLR, this is the right choice. It's my first DSLR & I'm really happy with the service & product. Thank you flipkart for delivering it the very next day. Awesome packaging & lower pro bag is pretty good."
29150,5,My first DSLR. Nice and genuine camera sent by Flipkart. But was delivered after many followups and two weeks after the order. Got it for 34K (with one lens) on big billion day sale. Nice deal I guess.!! About picture quality and camera quality I will write soon.
29151,5,"This is going to be quite funny.  I owned a Nikon D5200 and it pretty much served me well. I bought it for 16k from overkart (refurb) and it didn't have any complaints at all. Recently, I've been more into photography and thought of upgrading my d5200.  I didn't need a pro SLR as I ain't a full time photographer. But wanted a compact yet capable camera. I filtered out the suitable options and finally made into two ; Nikon D5600 and Canon 77d.  Now here begins the fun part. How to choose o..."
29152,4,"First of all, excellent delivery and packing by flipkart. amazing camera. very compact and small in size. easy to handle. stand kit lens 18-55 is good and af speed is super fast and super quiet.  only drawback - snapbridge is really bad !!"
29153,5,I've been using it since couple of days and it just impressed me. I am a beginner in photography yet this camera helped me capture some stunning shots.
29154,5,"5 on 5 stars Excellent camera with awesome and crisp quality Easy to use for beginners with simple settings.. love this camera and the lens 18-140mm Bought it for 53,000/-"
29155,5,so overall experience was good but flipkart has to work on their problems regarding packaging. As a assured customer of a flipkart we believe in you while purchasing costly products so you should do packing well not only for your satisfaction but for customer satisfaction. when we saw product packing we felt a sheer disappointment..but we are giving 3/5 for early delivery of product only. so pleased work on it..
29156,5,Great product from flipkart and delivery period is very short I just loved flipkart delivery time period....

29159,5,"Excellent entry level dslr for someone who wants to upgrade from mobile photography. 2016 model but Nikon has not released any other camera in this range. Well packed. Received in good condition. 18-55 mm and 70-300 mm kit lenses are okay for beginners. However, to get pro like pics, one needs to learn some editing (all pro photographers shoots in RAW format and edit their pics) . The provided Nikon bag is okay to start with along with the two kit lenses. Image quality is superb. You can buy ..."
29160,5,Really a joy to use. Very good camera to start with. It is my first DSLR and I am really very happy with the images and the focus. Good for photography to begin with. Not so good for video as it hunts for focus when we move from a subject which is annoying. I don't do much video so I really love this camera?
29161,5,Bought the camera as my first SLR camera being a enthusiatic amature photographer. The main reason to go for this over the D3500 is the rotating touch display which helps more than you think. The photography related aspects of the camera is identical to the D3500 but the features are more and AF points are also a bit more. In the world of fast growing mirrorless cameras the D5600 is truly still a great option for any entry level photographer. Most pohotographer do not need a full frame camera...
29162,5,"Awesome choice for beginners. It is my first DSLR and I like it so much. Flipkart delivered it within the promised time. Wanted to tell about the bag, I received NIKON original bag."
29163,5,"superb DSLR ,brought for my daughter very good pic. quality nd video quality with good sound,go for it without any ifs nd buts....... ...u will definitely like this product...."
29164,5,Just loving it every time I use it. It's handy and very convenient to handle.Images are mind blowing but you really need to use it manually for better results than auto mode. Flipkart took hardly a day to deliver it and the packing was good. Go for it without a second thought!
29165,5,"Before time delivery, great service flipkart... Product is great as expected... Good discount... Nice packaging, Got wellness band free... Delighted"
29166,5,Bought the camera in a perfect deal. A nice cam that suits beginner to pro users with a lot many handy features. The 18-55 kit lens delivers a promising performance. I'm very much satisfied with it. Thanks Flipkart for a great deal.
29167,5,Amazing product if one has the budget he should buy this camera with the dual lens because the combo pack is so good. The components was not even touched. and the components were also very clean and brand new the only thing that which I don't like is the proper bill with the guarantee warranty card. I don't get the warranty card inside the box so please mention that point overall the camera was good all the components for not even touched very clean and I will give this product 5 rates. Thank...
29168,5,One of the best product in this price range. Picture quality is awesome. 0ackaging was good too and the delivery was at my doorstep. Thank you.
29169,5,"I am writing this review after using one month. I have bought the camera at 42k with the dslr body & and 18-55mm kit lens. The image quality of this camera is really awesome & amd the kit lens works really well. Low light photography is preety good. If you're a beginner like me, this camera's functions would be slightly complicated but after a little bit experience, you'll be able to capture great quality pictures even without external equipments. I'll highly recommend you to buy this product..."
29170,5,"The product works exactly as promised. It is a very convenient dslr with built in intervalometer and a flip out display which makes the photo making process hassle free and more such features are worth paying a little extra than getting a D3500 or related segment camera.  Only DRAWBACK is that the battery life is low and the battery charger doesn't carry a warranty. My charger took its last breath right after one month of purchase, so I had to go for a 3rd party charger.  But overall I'd s..."

Lense cleaning kit is very useful & newly packed with warranty. It contains lense cleaner liquid, lense cleaner towel, lense cleaner tissue, cotton bud, dust blower and brush. The given uv filter doesn't bring any difference in photography, seems not so high in quality. Lense hood is also of good quality and it is tot..."

This camera is a great piece for people who are on a advanced beginner to a mid experience level. It offers all the functionalities that you would demand from a good DSLR and then it adds some tweaks here and there to spice up the experience for you.  What I was angry about was that the camera came with the AF-P lenses than AF-S lenses. Something I absolutely didn't see while ord..."

Camera is simply awesome and cute in size Light weight Beautiful architecture of camera structure so pleasant in hands never felt bulky Camera bag is provided as complimentary which is a good thing Battery backup is good too I am a beginner so I can't give technical review But I have heard from so many people this is a best camera to become a pro and even I felt the same Touch screen is awesome

29205,5,Amazing experience of this dslr camera . Great clarity in photos . Five stars from my side. SnapBridge app make available photos transfer to the phone directly
29206,4,Nice DSLR. Bag provided is Lowepro NOT Nikon. But lowepro bag is of very good quality. There are two lenses. Nikon in their India website says the following : E-COMMERCE WEBSITES/PORTALS ARE NOT OUR AUTHORIZED PARTNERS/ DEALERS IN INDIA FOR SALE OF NIKON PRODUCTS OR ACCESSORIES. We advise you to check the warranty entitlements of the products sold through e-commerce websites/ portals under the brand name ‚ÄòNikon‚Äô. But this was posted in their site on 09-09-2015.

29441,5,fabulous deal
29442,3,"Everything in the camera is good, but if you buy this from store, a Samsung bluetooth headset worth Rs 3000 is complementary with any DSLR camera, but if you buy from here seller doesn't send the bluetooth headset. This is the cheating as nikon himself is giving complementary headset, then what is the problem with seller for sending the same. Camera is fantastic and both the lenses are working superb. Thanks"
29443,5,NICEEEE CAMERA
29444,5,"In the Entry level DSLR category, this is the best option. D5600 is compared to 200D, but in real word 5600 fairs much better in all areas. Go for it!!"
29445,5,Garda product
29446,3,camera is fine but the free Samsung Bluetooth headphone was not provided
29447,5,"Everything is ok, but I got a camera backpack instead I wanted a sling bag to carry my camera. Now this sometimes make me uneasy to carry both laptop and camera together. So if you are looking for a backpack with the camera then no doubt, go for it but if you want a sling bag then, i think you should confirm it first from their services. Happy Clicking!"
29448,2,BATTERY SUPPLIED WITH CAMERA IS NOT OK. DISCHARGED WITH IN DAY WHILE TAKING ONLY AROUND 50-60 CLIKS.  NOT SATISFIED

29699,5,I am Very happy for my new Nikon DSLR Camera. It is in good working condition.
29700,4,Its been two days since I started using the camera. First thing to say is that I didn't get bag along with the product. They could have provided a bag as its a costly dslr. Some people said they got a headphone along with the product. I don't have any complaint about not getting the headphone. But carry bag is an essential accessory. 4 star only for this reason. Otherwise no complaints. It's a good product as we know.
29701,4,Very good üëçüëè

As you never know which lens you may need. 70-300 gives you great pictures. I always intend to use it only. Most of my shots are shot by it. 18-55 is used for close and wide shoot. 1 main disadvantage is that remote can't be connected to this camera.

30236,5,"Awesome camera. Even the low light photos are great with the kit lens. I am wondering what wonder this will do with prime lens. And one very important thing, The lenses for Nikon are way costlier than the Canon's. e.g. 50mm stm lens for canon is priced at around 7500 INR but 50 mm nikkor 1.8 g lens is 12500 INR, so choose the camera wisely. And if that does not bother you, you can buy this for sure. You will never regret the decision."
